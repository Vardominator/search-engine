You\n\n          don't want the only person waiting\n\n          for you at home to be a catcher.\n\n          Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on\n\n          the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him.\n\n                         JACK\n\n          Coach Sukeforth here said you were\n\n          starting a new Negro League.

They will do\n\n          anything to get you to react. If\n\n          you echo a curse with a curse, they\n\n          will only hear yours.

But if Jackie\n\n          does come up to the Dodgers, the\n\n          biggest threat to his success, the\n\n          one enemy most likely to ruin that\n\n          success, is the Negro people\n\n          themselves!\n\n          There is shocked silence in the room.

For on the day\n\n          Jackie enters the National League,\n\n          if he does, I have no doubt every\n\n          one of you will form parades and\n\n          welcoming committees.

Chapman\n\n          a hothead during his playing days\n\n          with the Yankees.\n\n          125 RICKEY - IN THE STANDS 125\n\n           Sitting next to Parrott.

Go back to Africa!\n\n          Phillie pitcher DUTCH LEONARD looks in. Jack has to try to\n\n          concentrate on the pitch. Here it comes. A fastball well\n\n          inside. Jack hits the deck to keep from getting beaned. \n\n                         CHAPMAN\n\n          Bojangles!

Even Walker doesn't\n\n          quite know what to make of it. No one enjoys it, but Higbe.\n\n                         STANDS\n\n          CONCESSION MEN walk closer to listen.

Hey, shoe shine!\n\n          WHITE 3-14-12 77.\n\n          Jack doesn't want to look over, but he is compelled. The\n\n          bench players flanking Chapman look furious, but Chapman is\n\n          doing this with a sick sort of glee.\n\n                         CHAPMAN\n\n          You like white girls?! Huh?!\n\n          Which one of them Dodger boys'\n\n          wives are you climbing on tonight?!\n\n          Chapman looks toward...\n\n                         DODGER DUGOUT\n\n          They don't like that one.\n\n          CHAPMAN (CONT'D)\n\n          Oh, I think I got it.

He hacks at it, lofts a routine fly into left.\n\n          He's about halfway down to first when the left fielder\n\n          catches it and Jack can mercifully return to the dugout.\n\n                         127 RICKEY 127\n\n          Rickey watches as he disappears inside. Finally exhales.\n\n                         128 BENCH 128\n\n          Jack sits down. No one says anything to him. No one comes\n\n          near him as he stares ahead, trapped in a kind of void. The\n\n          closest player to him is Bobby Bragan. Bragan finally\n\n          manages to glance over at him, then looks quickly away.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         129 RACHEL 129\n\n          As the Dodgers take the field, Jack heads to first. Almost\n\n          wincing, wondering if it's going to start again.\n\n                         RACHEL\n\n          (under her breath)\n\n          Look at me, baby. Look at me.\n\n          Finally, Jack glances up to her. She offers her eyes: I'm\n\n          with you. He looks away. Her witnessing makes it worse.\n\n                         130 BEN CHAPMAN 130\n\n          Settles back in the shadows of the dugout.

Bottom of the 3rd.\n\n                         INFIELD\n\n          Spider Jorgensen takes a lead off first. At the plate,\n\n          Stanky lines a single to right. Jorgensen holds at second.\n\n                         JACK\n\n          Steps to the batter's box, starts digging in that back foot.\n\n          VISITOR'S DUGOUT\n\n          As Chapman emerges with his two bench players. \n\n          PHILLIE ONE PHILLIE TWO \n\n          Hey, Nigger lips!

Dutch\n\n          watches his catcher Seminick settle under it. Waiting.\n\n                         DUTCH\n\n          Hey, is that a home run!?\n\n                         SEMINICK\n\n          Yeah! If you're playing in an\n\n          elevator shaft!\n\n          Jack veers off the first baseline. Heads for the dugout.\n\n                         CHAPMAN\n\n          You don't belong! Look in a mirror!\n\n          This is a white man's game. Get it\n\n          through your thick monkey skull!\n\n          Jack stops short looks at him. Chapman stands his ground.\n\n                         RICKEY\n\n          Stands, watches. Praying this doesn't go south. As Jack\n\n          finally continues on, Rickey closes his eyes in relief.\n\n                         RACHEL\n\n          Sick for her husband.\n\n          WHITE 3-14-12 79.\n\n                         THE DUGOUT\n\n          Jack stalks down past the team. No one looks at him. Bragan\n\n          is ashamed. Dixie tries to look disinterested. Stanky and\n\n          Reese exchange a helpless glance as Jack continues into:\n\n                         132 THE TUNNEL 132\n\n          Like a bull on his way to slaughter, he revolts. WHAM-WHAM!\n\n          He proceeds to turn his bat into SPLINTERS. Concrete chips,\n\n          wood flies. Jack drops the handle of the bat, pounds his\n\n          fists. Heaving for breath, framed by the empty tunnel. Raw,\n\n          electric, ungovernable. All the anger on display, the fury.\n\n          FEET SCRAPE. Jack looks up to see Rickey standing there,\n\n          watching, afraid to get too much closer.\n\n                         JACK\n\n          To hell with this. The next white\n\n          son of a bitch who opens his mouth,\n\n          I'll smash his goddamn teeth in.\n\n          Rickey stands there until finally, opening his mouth...\n\n                         RICKEY\n\n          You can't, Jackie.

And he looks, well, ferocious in fact.\n\n          As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box...\n\n          Jack stares at Dutch Leonard.
