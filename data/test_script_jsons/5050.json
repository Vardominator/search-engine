SAN DIEGO - DAY\n\n          It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches,\n\n          golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of\n\n          rapturous citizens.\n\n          EXT. BUS STOP - DAY\n\n          A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers.\n\n          We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered,\n\n          pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old\n\n          man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches\n\n          MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL.\n\n          INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n          Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one\n\n          would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked\n\n          away behind the sterile and monochrome walls.\n\n          Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is\n\n          engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores\n\n          Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do.\n\n          Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The\n\n          Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.\n\n                          RECEPTIONIST\n\n           Can I help you?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           I have an appointment.\n\n                          RECEPTIONIST\n\n           Name?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Adam Schwartz.\n\n          The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not\n\n          knowing what to do. He coughs again.\n\n          Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.\n\n           2.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n                          (CONFUSED)\n\n           Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?\n\n          With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n           Oh, should I go sit?\n\n          The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine.\n\n          Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and\n\n          browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time,\n\n          Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he\n\n          hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out:\n\n                          RECEPTIONIST\n\n           Adam Schwartz.\n\n          Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else\n\n          there. Again the receptionist calls out again -\n\n                          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)\n\n           Adam Schwartz.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Yeah, that's me.\n\n                          RECEPTIONIST\n\n           Follow me.\n\n          The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and\n\n          hands him a hospital gown.\n\n                          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)\n\n           Put this on.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Do I need to take off all my\n\n           clothes?\n\n          The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n           I'll figure it out.\n\n          The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips\n\n          on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the\n\n          front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides\n\n          he has it right.\n\n          Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find\n\n          JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse.\n\n           3.\n\n                          NURSE JOANNE\n\n           Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice\n\n           to meet you.\n\n          Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to\n\n          irritate his skin.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           You don't happen to have anything\n\n           in a cotton blend?\n\n                          NURSE JOANNE\n\n                          (LAUGHS)\n\n           Cotton. You're funny.\n\n          Joanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick\n\n          yellow line.\n\n           NURSE JOANNE (CONT'D)\n\n           Now I'm going to need you to fill\n\n           this cup with urine. You think you\n\n           can do that?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           You want me to fill this entire\n\n           cup.\n\n                          JOANNE\n\n           Yup.\n\n          Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           It's gonna take me at least a week\n\n           to fill this. Can I take it home?\n\n                          JOANNE\n\n                          (LAUGHS)\n\n           Take it home. You're so funny.\n\n          The CAMERA PANS to reveal a group of MEDICAL STUDENTS taking\n\n          diligent notes in the background. WE PAN AGAIN this time to\n\n          the next room:\n\n          INT. HOSPITAL. BATHROOM\n\n          Adam struggles to fill the cup. After a few beats, there's a\n\n          knock on the door.\n\n           JOANNE (O.S.)\n\n           You okay in there Adam?\n\n           4.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Just another minute.\n\n          Adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration. The CAMERA\n\n          PANS to the next room:\n\n          INT. HOSPITAL. X-RAY ROOM\n\n          Adam stands in front of an X-Ray machine. The APATHETIC\n\n          TECHNICIAN has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions\n\n          for long periods of time: sideways, one arm in the air, then\n\n          the other arm, on one leg, then the other, one leg in the\n\n          air, then the other, and so on.\n\n          Again we see the group of Medical Students taking notes. The\n\n          CAMERA PANS to the next room:\n\n          INT. HOSPITAL. EXAMINING ROOM\n\n          Joanne pulls out a giant needle.\n\n                          JOANNE\n\n           Here comes the choo-choo!\n\n          In the back we see the Med Students still taking notes. The\n\n          CAMERA PANS to the next room:\n\n          INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM\n\n          Adam is lying on the gurney of an MRI machine. He is slowly\n\n          drawn into the enclosed body scanner.\n\n                          TECHNICIAN\n\n                          (AUTHORITATIVELY)\n\n           Now make sure you lie completely\n\n           still. Otherwise we'll have to do\n\n           it all over again. Which we're not\n\n           going to have to do, right?\n\n          INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM - LATER\n\n          Adam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Hello? Is anybody out there?\n\n          There's no one there. He's been left unattended. The MRI\n\n          Technician is watching the Laker game in the next room.\n\n           5.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n           I have to pee.\n\n          The Med Students continue to take notes.\n\n          END OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE\n\n          EXT. SAN DIEGO - EVENING\n\n          Through the window of the hospital the CAMERA PULLS OUT and\n\n          PANS across the San Diego skyline. We watch as the Sun sets\n\n          to night, then rises to morning...\n\n          EXT. SAN DIEGO BEACH - MORNING\n\n                         SUPER: JUNE\n\n          It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to\n\n          lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard\n\n          is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then\n\n          rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n          About a mile inland, we come upon:\n\n          EXT. GRAND VIEW GATED COMMUNITY - DAY\n\n          Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with\n\n          lawns groomed to perfection fill the community. This is\n\n          Southern California Suburbia.\n\n          The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and\n\n          louder as we PUSH IN ON:\n\n          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n          The interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the\n\n          walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his\n\n          Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School\n\n          Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic\n\n          Achievement Award in the Sciences.\n\n          Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to\n\n          RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and\n\n          artsy, Rachel is \"Winnie Cooper\" all grown up.\n\n          The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud\n\n          obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up.\n\n          Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks\n\n          around in confusion.\n\n           6.\n\n          After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and\n\n          turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns\n\n          back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the\n\n          sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm\n\n          returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but\n\n          now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes\n\n          a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain\n\n          storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound\n\n          of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -\n\n                          RACHEL\n\n           (asleep and incoherent)\n\n           Make it stop.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n                          (WHISPERS)\n\n           It won't turn off.\n\n          Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only\n\n          makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds\n\n          simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she\n\n          puts a pillow over her head.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n                          (WHISPERS)\n\n           Sorry.\n\n          Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an\n\n          end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the\n\n          bed, collects himself.\n\n          Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck.\n\n                          RACHEL\n\n           Mmmmm.\n\n          Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair.\n\n          Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair.\n\n          She holds it up.\n\n                          RACHEL (CONT'D)\n\n           Oh my god.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           What?\n\n                          RACHEL\n\n           I think you have a gray hair.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Really?\n\n                          RACHEL\n\n           I'm gonna pull it out.\n\n           7.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           No! Don't touch it.\n\n          Adam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel\n\n          rolls back to sleep.\n\n          INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Adam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray\n\n          hair. Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. It\n\n          is in fact a gray hair. He smiles.\n\n          INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          As Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand,\n\n          but the bottle is empty. He looks over at Rachel's large\n\n          assortment of shower products, finds one that smells\n\n          pleasant, Fructis by L'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair.\n\n          He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product.\n\n          INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          Adam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. His outfit is\n\n          well put together, but not what you would expect of someone\n\n          his age - more of a Mr. Rogers look. He pulls out a LINT\n\n          BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan.\n\n          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER\n\n          SETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white\n\n          Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: \"Let's\n\n          put the Christ back in Christmas.\"\n\n          Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence,\n\n          Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit.\n\n          Just then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and\n\n          their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is\n\n          on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in\n\n          embarrassment.\n\n                          SETH\n\n           Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it?\n\n          The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight.\n\n          Adam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and\n\n          MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave\n\n          to Adam.\n\n           8.\n\n                          ANDREW\n\n           Hey Adam.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n                          (SEEMS ANNOYED)\n\n           Hey Andrew.\n\n                          ANDREW\n\n           Sorry about the noise last night.\n\n          Adam shrugs as if to say \"what the fuck?\" Andrew and Missy\n\n          giggle as they get into their car.\n\n          INT. SETH'S CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Adam gets into the car.\n\n                          SETH\n\n           Yo.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Yo.\n\n                          SETH\n\n           ...What's that smell?\n\n                          (SNIFFS ADAM)\n\n           Are you wearing perfume?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           No.\n\n                          SETH\n\n           Well, you smell like the cast of\n\n           Steel Magnolias.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n                          (SMELLS HIMSELF)\n\n           I ran out of shampoo. I had to use\n\n           Rachel's.\n\n                          SETH\n\n           For a second there I thought maybe\n\n           you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis.\n\n          Adam tries to close his window. The child safety lock is on.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Can you unlock my window? There's a\n\n           lot of pollen in the air.\n\n          Seth ignores Adam and turns up the music.\n\n           9.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n                          (ANNOYED)\n\n           Seriously, my allergies are flaring\n\n           up.

ROSS\n\n           (into the dictaphone)\n\n           Patient has been complaining of\n\n           excessive urination, back pain, and\n\n           night sweats. Blood tests and urine\n\n           analysis are normal. MRI indicates\n\n           a massive intraduaral extradural\n\n                          MALIGNANT SCHWANNOMA\n\n           neurofibrosarcomas extending into\n\n           psoas muscle with nerve root\n\n           compression syndrome and bone\n\n           erosion.\n\n          We see Adam's face gradually look more and more confused, he\n\n          slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question.\n\n           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)\n\n           Growth extends from the L2 to L5.\n\n           Cytotoxic antibiotics are\n\n           recommended.\n\n          Dr. Ross turns to see Adam holding his arm in the air.\n\n           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)\n\n           Yes. Questions?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n                          (DUMBFOUNDED)\n\n           I have no idea what you just said.\n\n           Is there something wrong with me?\n\n           18.\n\n           DR. ROSS\n\n           (points to MRI)\n\n           If you look here on your MRI, you\n\n           see this cephalopod like object\n\n           spreading down along your spinal\n\n           column?\n\n          Adam squints. It all looks the same.\n\n           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)\n\n           That is a massive schwannoma\n\n           neurofibrosarcomas.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           I still have no idea what you're\n\n           talking about.\n\n           DR. ROSS\n\n           It's a malignant tumor.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           What?!...A tumor? No.\n\n           DR. ROSS\n\n           I'm afraid so.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           How is that possible?...I don't\n\n           smoke. I don't drink. I eat\n\n           healthy...I even recycle.\n\n           DR. ROSS\n\n           Well Adam it's actually quite\n\n           fascinating. Your cancer is the\n\n           result of an incredibly rare gene\n\n           mutation in chromosome 17p in the\n\n           p53 Gene that causes the growth of\n\n           malignant cells in tissue around\n\n           the nerves. In your case it's grown\n\n           along the nerves in your lower\n\n           spine.\n\n          Adam looks at himself in the mirror.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           (still in denial)\n\n           But, look at me. I don't look sick.\n\n           DR. ROSS\n\n           Cancer often has no specific\n\n           symptoms. People can go years with\n\n           out knowing they're sick. We're\n\n           lucky we caught it before it\n\n           metastasizes.\n\n                          (MORE)\n\n           19.\n\n           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           I'm going to put you on a 4 month\n\n           regimen of chemotherapy. It's an\n\n           aggressive dosage so you might want\n\n           to think about taking some time off\n\n           from work.\n\n          This is real. Adam walks to the window and presses his face\n\n          against the glass. He looks down at the city below. From 15\n\n          stories up, the people on the street look like miniature\n\n          figurines.\n\n          Adam turns back to Dr. Ross.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Can't you just cut it out of me?\n\n           DR. ROSS\n\n           Yes, that is an option. But because\n\n           the tumor has spread to a such\n\n           significant size. Cutting it out\n\n           now would be risky.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Well what are my chances of beating\n\n           this?\n\n          Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are\n\n          seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but.\n\n           DR. Ross\n\n           Listen, you're in good hands. The\n\n           best thing for you to do right now\n\n           is to not worry...Let me do the\n\n           worrying. Alright?\n\n          Dr. Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face.\n\n           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)\n\n           Maybe you should talk to someone.\n\n          Dr. Ross hands Adam a business card for the \"Mount Sinai\n\n          Psychology Group\".\n\n           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)\n\n           We have a whole department of\n\n           psychologists here in the hospital.\n\n           They specialize in cases...in\n\n           these...sort of matters. They'll be\n\n           able to help you.\n\n          Not knowing what else to say, Dr. Ross looks at his watch,\n\n          looks back to Adam, and moves to the door.\n\n           20.\n\n           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)\n\n           Hang in there champ.\n\n          INT. SAN DIEGO PUBLIC LIBRARY - EVENING\n\n          CLOSE ON a computer screen:\n\n          \"Neurofibrosarcoma Schwannoma.

BUS - EVENING\n\n          Adam sits deep in thought.\n\n          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n          The bus stops. Adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a\n\n          deep breath...\n\n          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Adam enters the living room - it's empty. NPR News is on the\n\n          radio. Fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel. The\n\n          sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen.\n\n           21.\n\n           RACHEL (O.S.)\n\n           Adam? Is that you?\n\n          Adam walks into the kitchen. Rachel is at the stove cooking\n\n          in her underwear. Adam stands in the doorway watching her.\n\n          God she looks sexy. Rachel turns -\n\n                          RACHEL (CONT'D)\n\n           (in a Hungarian accent)\n\n           Welcome home Mr. Adam.

She holds up the offering\n\n          to Adam's mouth. He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to\n\n          hide his internal distress. His sad eyes tell Rachel another\n\n          story.\n\n                          RACHEL (CONT'D)\n\n           (still using accent)\n\n           What is wrong?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Nothing.\n\n                          RACHEL\n\n           (still using accent)\n\n           Liar.\n\n          This is not going to be easy.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           We need to talk.\n\n          Rachel drops the accent.

Soaking in the comfort, Adam rests his head\n\n          on her shoulder. She gently strokes his hair. Adam's hand\n\n          slowly moves down Rachel's back. He starts kissing her neck.\n\n          He knows it's wrong, but can't help it, the only thing\n\n          running through his mind is sex.\n\n          After a beat Rachel pulls away.\n\n                          RACHEL\n\n           (begins to cry)\n\n           You have cancer.\n\n           23.\n\n          Heart racing, Rachel opens the top pantry. She reaches back\n\n          as far as she can and pulls out a cookie jar. She sticks her\n\n          hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of American\n\n          Spirits.

He goes to put it\n\n          out, but takes a drag instead. He then hugs Rachel with one\n\n          hand and opens the window with the other; he proceeds to\n\n          discreetly fan out the cigarette smoke.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Sshhhh.

Katie\n\n          takes her job very seriously, but has not quite mastered the\n\n          art of speaking without sounding like a rigid grad student.\n\n          Kate looks up as she takes a bite of her sandwich.\n\n                          KATIE\n\n           (mouth full of food)\n\n           Can I help you?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           I have an appointment with Dr.\n\n           McRae.\n\n           34.\n\n          Katie puts down the sandwich, rises from her seat and puts\n\n          her hand out to shake Adam's.\n\n                          KATIE\n\n           Please call me Katie.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n                          (CONFUSED)\n\n           You're Dr. McRae?\n\n                          KATIE\n\n           You were expecting someone else?\n\n          Katie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Aren't you supposed to be like\n\n           sixty-five and wear earth toned\n\n           sweaters?\n\n                          KATIE\n\n                          (SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE)\n\n           Why?

When you say it, it's\n\n          like an indictment.

Cancer has come into your\n\n          life to show you that your\n\n          emotional and physical bodies are\n\n          out of balance. This is your chance\n\n          to correct that.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n          You're not in a cult are you?\n\n                          KATIE\n\n          Now, why do you say that?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n          I don't know, it was a bad joke.\n\n           37.\n\n                          KATIE\n\n           But there's a reason. You chose to\n\n           use humor rather than express how\n\n           you really feel.\n\n          Katie is losing Adam.\n\n                          KATIE (CONT'D)\n\n           In order to heal the body, you must\n\n           heal the mind. It's imperative that\n\n           you free yourself from stress and\n\n           anger. Get rid of all those\n\n           negative emotions stored deep\n\n           inside.\n\n          Adam's mind drifts away from Katie. He focuses on all the\n\n          clutter. The slanted clock. The wilting plant. The crumbled\n\n          paper on the floor. The mess is driving him crazy.\n\n                          KATIE (CONT'D)\n\n           So today what I want to do is start\n\n           you on some very simple relaxation\n\n           therapy.\n\n          Katie presses play on her iPod. We hear the soothing sounds\n\n          of new agey flute music.

Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he\n\n          doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention.\n\n          He finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the\n\n          stain.\n\n                          KATIE (CONT'D)\n\n           Close your eyes and relax.

Here we see exquisitely\n\n           preserved objects that offer a\n\n           glimpse into the day-to-day life of\n\n           this ancient city.\n\n          Seth comes upon Adam who is working closely on a diorama.\n\n                          SETH (CONT'D)\n\n           This here is Adam, one of our\n\n           curators.

The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the\n\n          air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women,\n\n          and children run through the streets in horror. People are\n\n          sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild\n\n          orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model\n\n          devours a villager.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n           According to Pliny the Younger -\n\n           \"You could hear women lamenting,\n\n           children crying, men shouting.\n\n           There were some so afraid of death\n\n           that they prayed for death.

The morphine offers immediate\n\n          relief. He lays back in total bliss, and then...\n\n          FADE OUT TO WHITE LIGHT.\n\n          EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY\n\n                         SUPER: NOVEMBER\n\n          A door bell. A hand reaches out. A finger on that hand pushes\n\n          the door bell. The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers.\n\n          The hand belongs to Mitch's wife, MARGARET (80). She stands\n\n          on the porch of a small beach bungalow.\n\n          The front door opens. Margaret looks straight ahead. Nothing.\n\n          She then looks down, startled by Adam in a wheelchair.\n\n                          MARGARET\n\n                          (STARTLED)\n\n           Oh, hello, I didn't see you, ah\n\n           down there.\n\n          There's a glow in Adam's face - he looks younger and more\n\n          jovial than we've ever seen.\n\n           117.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           You must be Margaret.\n\n                          MARGARET\n\n           Yes, I'm looking for Adam Schwartz.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           That's me.\n\n                          MARGARET\n\n           (face lights up)\n\n           You're Adam? The way Mitch\n\n           described you, I always assumed you\n\n           to be much older. About 50 years\n\n           older. But, you're just a baby...\n\n          Adam blushes.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           I'm so glad you could make it.\n\n                          (SOLEMN)\n\n           I'm really sorry about Mitch.\n\n                          MARGARET\n\n           Me too.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           Please come inside. You're just in\n\n           time.\n\n          Adam leads Margaret inside, past a dozen oversized boxes.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n           Sorry about the mess. I just moved\n\n           in...The ocean air is supposed to\n\n           be good for my recovery.\n\n          INT. ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Adam and Margaret enter the living room. Everyone's there:\n\n          Edith, Art, Katie and Seth.\n\n          Seth and Katie are playing a video game: DUCK HUNT. Edith\n\n          sets food on the table.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n                          (TO MARGARET)\n\n           We're having a Duck Hunt\n\n           tournament. You play?\n\n           118.\n\n                          MARGARET\n\n                          (LAUGHS)\n\n           Me? Oh I don't know how to play\n\n           video games.\n\n          Adam holds up the controller - an old Nintendo Gun.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           It's really easy. One button does\n\n           everything.\n\n          Edith chimes in from across the room.\n\n                          EDITH\n\n           This food's not going to eat\n\n           itself.\n\n          Everyone makes their way to the table. Visibly weak, Adam\n\n          slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair. He yelps in pain.\n\n          Katie starts to help when Seth intervenes.\n\n                          SETH\n\n           I got it.\n\n          Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a\n\n          small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the\n\n          table. Katie places a pillow behind Adam's back.\n\n          Adam takes Katie's hand, she looks down at him, they exchange\n\n          a smile.\n\n          Adam notices and open window.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n                          (TO SETH)\n\n           You mind?\n\n          Seth ignores Adam as he fills both their plates with food.\n\n                          ADAM (CONT'D)\n\n           Please. I think there's a red tide\n\n           or something. My eyes are all\n\n           itchy. It feels like someone is\n\n           rubbing sandpaper on my corneas.\n\n                          SETH\n\n           (as he serves Adam)\n\n           Nope. You don't have cancer\n\n           anymore. No more special treatment.\n\n                          ADAM\n\n           I am still in remission.\n\n           119.\n\n                          EDITH\n\n           You gonna spend the rest of your\n\n           life complaining?\n\n                          ADAM\n\n                          (PROUD)\n\n           I like complaining.\n\n          We FREEZE on the family sitting around the dinner table.\n\n          We hear the song \"That's the Way The World Goes Round\" by\n\n          John Prine as we:\n\n           FADE TO BLACK.\n\n                          THE END"}
