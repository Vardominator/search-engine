LOWER MANHATTAN SKYLINE - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING    1\n\n    RUSH HOUR\n\n    ON a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently\n\n    pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike. ADJUST ANGLE now\n\n    to meet the bicyclist...\n\n    He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears\n\n    wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased\n\n    slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at\n\n    once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass\n\n    on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD.\n\n    ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade\n\n    bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind\n\n    him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers.\n\n    Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft.\n\n    above the East River.\n\n    A fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks\n\n    back and forth as he pumps the pedals.\n\n    FROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the\n\n    bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour\n\n    traffic on the bridge below.\n\n2   EXT.

The house is dark\n\n     except for a porch light.\n\n     Trevor and Ellen are greeted by Ellen's golden retriever\n\n     Jack, who's chained to the front porch. JACK WHIMPERS,\n\n     ready to bark.\n\n                             ELLEN\n\n               Don't start barking, Jack.\n\n                             TREVOR\n\n                      (petting him)\n\n               Hey there, boy.

They look at each other timidly for a\n\n     moment. Now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently\n\n     adjusts her stance. The result is a kiss that doesn't\n\n     quite hit her mouth.
