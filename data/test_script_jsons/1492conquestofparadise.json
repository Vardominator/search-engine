AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY\n\n\tWe start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a\n\n\tsplendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the\n\n\tgarter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate\n\n\thands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large\n\n\ttopaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing\n\n\ton marble floors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tA Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,\n\n\tdark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is\n\n\tTREASURER SANCHEZ.\n\n\tA door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We\n\n\tcan now here a subdued conversation.\n\n\tTREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:\n\n\tThe door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.\n\n\tA WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN\n\n\tISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.\n\n\tHe bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large\n\n\ttable.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and\n\n\tthree dignitaries of Church and State.\n\n\tAll sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document\n\n\tand starts to read aloud.\n\n\tOn screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\n\t\t\tYour Majesty would wish to know the\n\n\t\t\ttrue facts concerning the island of\n\n\t\t\tHispanola, our first settlement in\n\n\t\t\tthe New World, and the activities\n\n\t\t\tthere of your servant, Christopher\n\n\t\t\tColumbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,\n\n\t\t\tGovernor of that Island.  You will\n\n\t\t\tremember with what hopes and\n\n\t\t\tpromises he beguiled us -- the truth\n\n\t\t\tis that he now presides over a state\n\n\t\t\tof chaos, degradation and madness\n\n\t\t\tbeyond imagining.\n\n\tSANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\n\t\t\tFrom the beginning, Columbus proved\n\n\t\t\thimself incapable of managing the\n\n\t\t\taffairs of the island.  He appointed\n\n\t\t\this brothers to important positions,\n\n\t\t\tat once injuring the pride and\n\n\t\t\tdignity of the nobles who had gone\n\n\t\t\twith him.  He promised to build a\n\n\t\t\tcity, the City of Isabel, named\n\n\t\t\tafter Your Majesty.  What he\n\n\t\t\tactually built was nothing but a\n\n\t\t\tcollection of huts, and that in the\n\n\t\t\twrong place, for all of it was\n\n\t\t\teasily swept away by rain and mud.\n\n\t\t\tIs that not so, Brother Buyl?\n\n\tThe PRIEST nods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBROTHER BUYL\n\n\t\t\tYes, Your Honor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\n\t\t\tHe promised gold.  Not finding the\n\n\t\t\teasy quantities he promised,\n\n\t\t\tColumbus commanded each Indian to\n\n\t\t\tpay an annual tribute.  Most being\n\n\t\t\tunable to, they were barbarously\n\n\t\t\tpunished, against the express wish\n\n\t\t\tof Your Christian Majesties...\n\n\tISABEL lowers her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\n\t\t\tSince provocation and injustice\n\n\t\t\tnever ceases, many of the Indians\n\n\t\t\thave fled to the forests, or have\n\n\t\t\tbegun to slay the Christians.\n\n\tISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tISABEL\n\n\t\t\tCould it be so?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBROTHER BUYL\n\n\t\t\tYes, Your Majesty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\n\t\t\tBut there is worse.  From the\n\n\t\t\tbeginning, he forced the nobles to\n\n\t\t\tundergo physical labor, treating\n\n\t\t\tthem equally with the Indians, all\n\n\t\t\tof them reduced to slavery.  When\n\n\t\t\tthe nobleman Adrian de Moxica\n\n\t\t\tprotested against such treatment...\n\n\t\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\n\t\t\t... he was executed.\n\n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\n\t\t\tIs that not true also, Brother\n\n\t\t\tBuyl?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBROTHER BUYL\n\n\t\t\tYes, Your Honor.  It is all true.\n\n\t\t\tAll of it.  I saw it with my own\n\n\t\t\teyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\n\t\t\tHe has lost control.  His great\n\n\t\t\tarrogance has led him into\n\n\t\t\tdepravity.  He encourages our\n\n\t\t\tsoldiers to marry the native women.\n\n\t\t\tHe promised a paradise, but he has\n\n\t\t\tmade a hell full of all its horrors.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tISABEL\n\n\t\t\tIs that the man I knew, Treasurer\n\n\t\t\tSanchez?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\n\t\t\tYes, Your Majesty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT.

The sun set in the west on an\n\n\t\t\tocean where no man had dared to\n\n\t\t\tventure.  And beyond that,\n\n\t\t\tinfinity...\n\n\tPulling back, we discover:\n\n\tA TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle\n\n\tthirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten\n\n\tface frames unusually bright eyes.\n\n\tOn the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491\n\n\tCOLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at\n\n\tthe top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO\n\n\tlooks up at him in adoration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO (V.O.)\n\n\t\t\tOnce I asked my Father where he\n\n\t\t\twanted to go.  And he replied:  \"I\n\n\t\t\twant to travel all over the seas.  I\n\n\t\t\twant to get behind the weather...\"\n\n\tFERNANDO laughs.

High-\n\n\tspirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching\n\n\this SON'S antics with amusement.

CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY\n\n\tAs they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,\n\n\tFERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under\n\n\tthe ROMAN arches.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\n\t\t\tDiego!\n\n\tHe rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an\n\n\tadolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,\n\n\tdelicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tDiego!  Aren't you going to kiss\n\n\t\t\tyour brother?\n\n\tDIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is\n\n\timmediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,\n\n\thurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.\n\n\tThe MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-\n\n\thaired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.\n\n\tMARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his\n\n\tarms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns\n\n\tto DIEGO.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\n\t\t\tDiego, take Fernando to the dining\n\n\t\t\thall.  He must be hungry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDIEGO\n\n\t\t\tYes, Father.\n\n\tBoth CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.

MARCHENA pushes open a\n\n\tdoor.\n\n\tINT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY\n\n\tHundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the\n\n\tmiracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several\n\n\tMONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily\n\n\t\"ILLUMINATING\" some of these massive volumes, delicately\n\n\tpainting around the letters in bright colors and gold\n\n\tleaf.\n\n\tRays of light fall diagonally through high openings,\n\n\tprojecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As\n\n\tMARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is\n\n\tpunctuated by light and shadow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\n\t\t\t\t(fumbles in a pocket\n\n\t\t\t\tunder his robe)\n\n\t\t\tI have something for you.\n\n\tAlmost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\n\t\t\tYou will be heard at the University\n\n\t\t\tof Salamanca...\n\n\tCOLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.

STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY\n\n\tMARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the\n\n\tfloor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,\n\n\tinstruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an\n\n\tinquiring mind.\n\n\tWith practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a\n\n\thundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits\n\n\tbehind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA\n\n\tlights a candle and considers the mess.  Then\n\n\tmethodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him\n\n\twith his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.\n\n\tWhen he looks up again, there is a new severity in his\n\n\texpression.

COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING\n\n\tDIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS\n\n\tappears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to\n\n\tgo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tDiego.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes\n\n\tmeet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tWould you like to come and stay with\n\n\t\t\tus?\n\n\tUncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an\n\n\tanswer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tI'll do whatever makes you happy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDIEGO\n\n\t\t\tI am happy, Father.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.\n\n\tHe climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his\n\n\tBROTHER as they ride off.\n\n\tEXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT\n\n\tCOLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,\n\n\tthrough narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the\n\n\tair.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with\n\n\texcitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then\n\n\tmore people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,\n\n\trowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.\n\n\tHuge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside\n\n\tthe cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS\n\n\ttries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens\n\n\tin the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the\n\n\tcenter of the square stand three pyres, already alit.\n\n\tHOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\n\t\t\tLook, Father!\n\n\tBefore COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the\n\n\tmule and into the crowd.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tFernando!\n\n\tBut the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night\n\n\tsky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with\n\n\ta lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.\n\n\tFERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.\n\n\tA PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a\n\n\tMAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the \"sambenito\", a\n\n\trobe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been\n\n\tcrudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,\n\n\tindicating that the man is Jewish.\n\n\tTHE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss\n\n\tthe crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.\n\n\tFERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't\n\n\trealize what is happening.  He is too close to the\n\n\tplatform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tFernando!\n\n\tHe motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him\n\n\taway from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The\n\n\tdistance now allows him to see inside the flames.\n\n\tA HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a\n\n\tsilent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the\n\n\thead falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses\n\n\tinto the fire.\n\n\tINT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT\n\n\tCOLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,\n\n\tstone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is\n\n\tmute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes\n\n\tthe mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,\n\n\tBEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a\n\n\tbeautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic\n\n\tpersonality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.

Gold!\n\n\tThe INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing.\n\n\tWe see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold\n\n\tornaments.\n\n\tPINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.  The INDIAN\n\n\tremoves the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON,\n\n\twho indicates that he wants to have it.  The INDIAN nods\n\n\t-- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants\n\n\tit in return.  PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN\n\n\tfrom taking it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\t\t(to Pinzon)\n\n\t\t\tGive it to him!\n\n\tPINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS\n\n\tinsists.

Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by\n\n\tthe blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling\n\n\tup... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his\n\n\tclumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN\n\n\tlaughs.\n\n\tJust outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw,\n\n\tsquatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN.\n\n\tINT.  TENT - DAWN\n\n\tThe first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds\n\n\tof the jungle all around.  COLUMBUS writes in his journal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS (V.O.)\n\n\t\t\tOctober 21st, 1492.  I think we have\n\n\t\t\treturned to Eden.  Surely this is\n\n\t\t\thow the world once was, before the\n\n\t\t\tbeginning of time.  I believe no man\n\n\t\t\twill ever see this land again as we\n\n\t\t\tdo, for the first time...\n\n\tHe looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the\n\n\thut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink\n\n\ton his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the\n\n\tmargin of his log-book.  He draws well.\n\n\tHe gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the\n\n\tdrawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked\n\n\tand amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own\n\n\timage... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS\n\n\tlaughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a\n\n\tgesture of friendship.\n\n\tUTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he\n\n\twishes to offer.\n\n\tEXT.  JUNGLE - MORNING\n\n\tUTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS\n\n\tfollows him.\n\n\tUTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN\n\n\tlooks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, and\n\n\tfilters through the foliage.  As if the time had come,\n\n\tUTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.\n\n\tA gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering.\n\n\tGold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS\n\n\tdiscovers --\n\n\tA large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has\n\n\tturned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples\n\n\twith the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger\n\n\tsatisfied?  Isn't this what he came for?\n\n\tCOLUMBUS plunges into the pool.

He then looks up at\n\n\tCOLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into\n\n\tthe water without a word.\n\n\tThe group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the\n\n\thumidity.

MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY\n\n\tUTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.  Fully\n\n\tarmed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and\n\n\tthe vicious insect bites.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly\n\n\ttrots forward.\n\n\tFinally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.

Wait!\n\n\tUTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with\n\n\tcomical energy.\n\n\tOn their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning\n\n\tagainst a tree.  He has removed his helmet.  His hair\n\n\tsticking to his forehead.\n\n\tAs COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another\n\n\tSAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around\n\n\tPINZON.

CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT\n\n\tIn the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS,\n\n\tMENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a\n\n\tSpanish helmet on his head.  The helmet is too big, almost\n\n\tcovering his eyes.  The ELDERS appraise the gift with\n\n\tsolemn wonder.\n\n\tIn return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of\n\n\tleaves.  COLUMBUS unwraps them.  Inside:  a GOLD grimacing\n\n\tmask.  The first real piece of gold.  COLUMBUS is unable\n\n\tto conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of\n\n\tthe metal.\n\n\tHe waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks\n\n\tat him.  On the ground, we see other presents offered by\n\n\tthe SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\n\t\t\t\t(to Columbus)\n\n\t\t\tYou come!

It rises five meters into the air then\n\n\tfalls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.\n\n\tWaves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for\n\n\tmercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard\n\n\tabove the storm.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a\n\n\tlifeline.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\t\t(screaming to the\n\n\t\t\t\tsailors)\n\n\t\t\tGet below!

The\n\n\twood groans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tWe may have to cut it!\n\n\tMENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.

Shy and scared.\n\n\tThey stare at this \"Centaur\" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN\n\n\tseem to be one -- a God).\n\n\tTo impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move\n\n\tsideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing\n\n\tthe air.  THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,\n\n\twho stands his ground, brandishing his lance.\n\n\tUTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the\n\n\tcentaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the\n\n\tanimal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back\n\n\tcomically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.\n\n\tWithout warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  More\n\n\tINDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.

Get out!\n\n\tTHE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed\n\n\tat the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.\n\n\tThey are running through the dense forest for the river\n\n\tbank.\n\n\tThe CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running\n\n\talongside.  Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their\n\n\tbrutal faces painted in black.  They release arrows at the\n\n\trunning SOLDIERS.  A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground,\n\n\tfires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but\n\n\the is pierced by a spear.  TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut\n\n\this throat to finish him.\n\n\tELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDS\n\n\tand CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.\n\n\tA CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his\n\n\tlance.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his\n\n\tabdomen.  Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who\n\n\tcollapses.  Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.\n\n\tHe stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood.\n\n\tShocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at\n\n\tit.\n\n\tA GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody\n\n\tfingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating\n\n\twings.  FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to\n\n\this feet.  They run...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tTHE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running\n\n\thard to the boat.  ARROWS whistle around them as they leap\n\n\tinto the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them\n\n\tinto the current.\n\n\tSOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank.  But\n\n\tthe canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.\n\n\tEXT.  SHIP AT SEA - DAY\n\n\tEndless seascape, the caravel plowing.\n\n\tEXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY\n\n\tFERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a\n\n\tblanket.  He seems in a state of shock:  he is pale and\n\n\tshaking.  As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands\n\n\thim a flask of alcohol.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\t\t(kindly)\n\n\t\t\tTake it.  Come on.  Drink.\n\n\tAs COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO\n\n\tnotices that his hands are shaking too.  His FATHER'S\n\n\tforehead is dripping with sweat.\n\n\tFERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces.  He drinks again and\n\n\thands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same.\n\n\tFERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tI...

Never!\n\n\tHe walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the\n\n\trail.  He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain,\n\n\tas if they were burning.  FERNANDO scrambles to his feet\n\n\tand rushes to him.  COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed\n\n\tsomewhere -- fever is eating him up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tWill you ever forgive me?\n\n\tFERNANDO turns around for help.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tCaptain Mendez!\n\n\tINT.

LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY\n\n\tANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a\n\n\tsiesta next to his grapes.  He is sitting in a simple\n\n\tarmchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.\n\n\tThe presence of someone wakes him.  After a moment, he\n\n\trecognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.

BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING\n\n\tFERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining\n\n\tdocuments and letters.  COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl\n\n\taround his legs.  He looks even older now, with his mass\n\n\tof pure white hair.\n\n\tBEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a\n\n\tdecanter of water.  She places it on a small table near\n\n\tCOLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.\n\n\tAs she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her\n\n\tback.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tCan't you stay with us a little?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEATRIX\n\n\t\t\tI am busy inside.\n\n\tHe smiles.

He says they hope\n\n\t\t\tto get your privileges restored...\n\n\t\t\tAnd maybe the house.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very\n\n\tlittle importance to him now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\n\t\t\tBut how is he?  And Dona Maria?\n\n\tFERNANDO continues to read.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\n\t\t\tFine, it seems.  Diego is thinking\n\n\t\t\tof starting a pearl trade, in Santo\n\n\t\t\tDomingo...
