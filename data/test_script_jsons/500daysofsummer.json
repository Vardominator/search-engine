PARK - DAY\n\n          For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a\n\n          park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says\n\n          a word.\n\n          CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No\n\n          words are spoken.

Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t-\n\n          shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to\n\n          balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.\n\n                              NARRATOR\n\n                    The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New\n\n                    Jersey, grew up believing that he'd\n\n                    never truly be happy until the day\n\n                    he met his... \"soulmate.\"\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n          INT LIVING ROOM - 1989\n\n          PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie.

Awesome. That's just\n\n                     great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.\n\n          Tom walks a few more steps.\n\n          And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even\n\n          noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED\n\n          HIM INTO A KISS!\n\n          It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure\n\n          if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out\n\n          of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually\n\n          happening.\n\n          (29)\n\n          FADE UP: \"YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE\" by Hall and Oates.\n\n                                                                  38.\n\n          EXT STREET - MORNING\n\n          It's the greatest morning of all time!\n\n          Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts\n\n          down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes,\n\n          winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out\n\n          his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.\n\n          People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.\n\n          A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the\n\n          HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody\n\n          loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom\n\n          singing the song.\n\n          Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also\n\n          pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last\n\n          night. He walks on, the man.

She puts hers\n\n          there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches\n\n          Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the\n\n          way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain\n\n          notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry\n\n          at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply\n\n          overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this\n\n          girl.\n\n                                                                    57.\n\n          Marley sings:\n\n                              B.M.\n\n                    \"In life I know there's lots of\n\n                    grief/ but your love is my relief.\"\n\n          We know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight.\n\n          (172)\n\n          INT PARTY - NIGHT\n\n          Tom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party.\n\n          TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with,\n\n          drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom\n\n          notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's\n\n          clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention\n\n          they're getting from her.

Then she walks ahead of him into the\n\n          theatre. He's forced to follow. Answer-less, as conflicted as\n\n          ever. Why is none of this easy?\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n          INT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER\n\n          Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold,\n\n          emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact,\n\n          something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her\n\n          head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie.\n\n          ANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN.

When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets\n\n          fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away\n\n          like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent,\n\n          horrible on-screen death.\n\n          (228)\n\n          INT CLUB - NIGHT\n\n          Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking\n\n          miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not\n\n          really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with\n\n          everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with\n\n          sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.\n\n                              SUMMER\n\n                    You're not having any fun.\n\n                              TOM\n\n                    You're having enough for both of\n\n                    us.\n\n                              SUMMER\n\n                    I'm dancing.

Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the\n\n          music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is\n\n          alone.

Or, more accurately, Tom sulks\n\n          down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad,\n\n          broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still\n\n          Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.\n\n          He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's\n\n          brother Clint looks back.\n\n          Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.\n\n          He walks by a sign that says \"TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER.\" He\n\n          doesn't even stop.\n\n          Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.\n\n          The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for\n\n          directions.

If it looks familiar,\n\n          it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful\n\n          day Tom described to his sister and his friends.

Unless we were\n\n          looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we\n\n          might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the\n\n          aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's\n\n          distant. But only if we're really looking.\n\n          (406)\n\n          INT. APARTMENT - LATER\n\n          Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment\n\n          again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.\n\n          LATER. He hangs some new pictures.\n\n          LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.\n\n          Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He\n\n          draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail\n\n          something.\n\n                                                                   104.\n\n          (240)\n\n          INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER\n\n          That day again.

Something's in the air.\n\n          INT MOVIE - LATER\n\n          Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in\n\n          Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to\n\n          look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to\n\n          be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.\n\n          (409)\n\n          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n          Tom drawing a straight line on his wall.

He extends it a little bit.\n\n          He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall.\n\n          From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to\n\n          form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,\n\n          almost shaped like a tear drop.\n\n          (240)\n\n          EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER\n\n          Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's\n\n          alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after\n\n          that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.\n\n                                 TOM\n\n                       Hey.\n\n          He goes to hug her. He hugs her.

She smiles and they continue on down\n\n          the aisles.\n\n          In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.\n\n          It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand\n\n          approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it\n\n          at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if\n\n          there's something to read in that.\n\n          (411)\n\n          EXT HARBOR - DAY\n\n          Tom sketches intensely.

INT LIBRARY - DAY\n\n          Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,\n\n          reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building\n\n          design.\n\n          3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY\n\n          Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the\n\n          lobby of a high-rise.\n\n          4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY\n\n          Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing\n\n          soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.\n\n          6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n          Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on\n\n          his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of\n\n          futuristic looking structures). He crosses \"Abrams and\n\n          Abrams\" off the list. We notice several others are also\n\n          crossed off.\n\n          5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY\n\n          Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring\n\n          the distance between the beams of the bridge.\n\n          8. EXT PARK - DAY\n\n          Tom jogs. A little faster this time.\n\n          9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,\n\n          crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He\n\n          sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost\n\n          in thought.\n\n                                                                    109.\n\n          Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,\n\n          he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.\n\n          9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY\n\n          On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.\n\n          Thinking.\n\n          On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is\n\n          lifted. And she's a bride.\n\n          END MUSIC.\n\n          (478)\n\n          EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY\n\n          Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal\n\n          interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In\n\n          the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took\n\n          Summer ages ago.\n\n          EXT. PARK - DAY\n\n          Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost\n\n          in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.\n\n                                 SUMMER (V.O.)\n\n                       Hey.\n\n          Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She\n\n          may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.\n\n          Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to\n\n          do.\n\n                                 SUMMER\n\n                           (re: suit)\n\n                       Where you coming from?\n\n                                 TOM\n\n                       What?

If I\n\n                    showed up to eat ten minutes later?\n\n                    Tom, it was meant to be, just like\n\n                    you said. And as it was happening,\n\n                    I knew it. I could feel it, sure as\n\n                    the sun. And I kept thinking to\n\n                    myself \"Holy shit.

Summer takes his hand. We may notice her\n\n          wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact\n\n          shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a\n\n          few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.\n\n                              SUMMER\n\n                    Anyway, I should probably be\n\n                    getting back.

There's a silence for a few beats. And it's\n\n          during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we\n\n          can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this\n\n          girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.\n\n          And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.\n\n                                 TOM\n\n                    So, uh...\n\n                                 GIRL\n\n                    Hmm?\n\n                              TOM\n\n                    Are you from...California?\n\n                              GIRL\n\n                    Grew up not too far from here.\n\n                    Atherton, near Stanford.\n\n                              TOM\n\n                    I know Atherton.

But halfway through the doorway, he pauses\n\n          and looks back at the girl.\n\n                                                                 117.\n\n                              NARRATOR\n\n                    If Tom had learned anything... it\n\n                    was that you can't ascribe great\n\n                    cosmic significance to a simple\n\n                    earthly event. Coincidence. That's\n\n                    all anything ever is. Nothing more\n\n                    than coincidence.\n\n          ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.\n\n          Hardly noticeable. But it's there.\n\n                               NARRATOR\n\n                    It took a long time but Tom had\n\n                    finally learned. There are no\n\n                    miracles. There's no such thing as\n\n                    fate. Nothing is meant to be. He\n\n                    knew.
