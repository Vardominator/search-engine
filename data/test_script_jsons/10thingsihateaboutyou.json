Chastity opens the note and reads:\n\n          INSERT - \"JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH!

KAT'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n          Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling \n\n          with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she's happy with and \n\n          Patrick quickly changes it.\n\n                                 PATRICK\n\n                    I'm driving, so I get to pick the \n\n                    tunes.\n\n          She changes it back to her song.\n\n                                 KAT\n\n                    It's my car.\n\n          He changes it back.\n\n                                 PATRICK\n\n                    And I'm in control of it.\n\n                                 KAT\n\n                    But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like \n\n                    them.
