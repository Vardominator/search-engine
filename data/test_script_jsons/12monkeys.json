SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE, wearing the \"space suit\" and a helmet with a plastic visor,\n\n\tsteps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door\n\n\tclangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker\n\n\tnow as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.\n\n\tOn the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.\n\n\tCOLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It\n\n\tINT.

CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)\n\n\tA SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved\n\n\taside.  COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in\n\n\tmoonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people\n\n\tanywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.\n\n\tEXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.\n\n\tMoving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for\n\n\tsomething.  Finds it.  An insect.\n\n\tCOLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it\n\n\tinto a collection tube, something makes him turn.\n\n\tThere's something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.\n\n\tCOLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the\n\n\tlight, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.\n\n\tANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.\n\n\tThen, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the\n\n\tflashlight, it pads quickly down the street.\n\n\tINT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT\n\n\tUsing the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked\n\n\tfloor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!\n\n\tThe only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.\n\n\tThen, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More\n\n\tdogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It's a DOGFIGHT!\n\n\tEXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)\n\n\tA giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings\n\n\tand lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.\n\n\tBelow, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted\n\n\tbuildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.\n\n\tINT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large\n\n\tSPIDER tries to hide from the light.\n\n\tCOLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and\n\n\tputs it into one of his specimen tubes.\n\n\tThen, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There's\n\n\tnothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.\n\n\tEXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN\n\n\tAs COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the\n\n\tbuilding.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled\n\n\tlogo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is\n\n\twritten, \"WE DID IT!\"\n\n\tCOLE looks up.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION\n\n\tpatrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.\n\n\t\t\tTTTLES END\n\n\tINT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT\n\n\tROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the\n\n\twall, pummel the still-suited COLE.\n\n\tINT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT\n\n\tStark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on\n\n\tlong poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING\n\n\tFIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their\n\n\twindowed masks.  It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,\n\n\tdripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,\n\n\t\t\t\tAMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)\n\n\t\tRaise your arms above your head.\n\n\tCOLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.\n\n\tINT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n\n\tStill naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN\n\n\tin a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws\n\n\tblood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.\n\n\tCOLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque \"window\" of thick\n\n\tplastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk\n\n\tbehind the translucent aperture, studying him.\n\n\tThe TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.\n\n\tINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT\n\n\tUshered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...\n\n\ta blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces\n\n\theaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with\n\n\tstring, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a\n\n\tdilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering\n\n\tbooks and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference\n\n\ttable, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,\n\n\tBOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent\n\n\ta \"modern\" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,\n\n\toutdated, patched-together technologies.\n\n\t\t\t\tTINY\n\n\t\tJames Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\n\t\tThank you.  You two wait outside.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCARFACE\n\n\t\tHe's got a history, Doctor.

You're\n\n\t\tnot going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?\n\n\tCOLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\n\t\tNo, sir.\n\n\tThe GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\n\t\tWhy don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.\n\n\tCOLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST\n\n\t\tWe want you to tell us about last\n\n\t\tnight.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\n\t\tI went to the surface and I collected\n\n\t\tspecimens like I was told.\n\n\tThe SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\n\t\t\t(worried)\n\n\t\tI mashed the spider, didn't I?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\n\t\tWe'll get to the spider later, Mr.\n\n\t\tCole.  Right now, we want to know\n\n\t\teverything that you saw.\n\n\tINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard\n\n\tsketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTPOPHYSICIST\n\n\t\tWhere you collected sample #4, what\n\n\t\tstreet was that?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\n\t\tUh...\n\n\t\t\t\tBOTANIST\n\n\t\tIt's important to observe everything.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\n\t\tI think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.\n\n\tAs the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,\n\n\tCOLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the\n\n\twall.  One headline screams, \"VIRUS MUTATING!\"  Another features\n\n\ta photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)\n\n\tand the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, \"IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE\".\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\n\t\tClose your eyes, Cole.\n\n\tStartled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.\n\n\tBLACKNESS.

CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY\n\n\tTHE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked\n\n\tby his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE\n\n\tland through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse\n\n\tleading to the departure gates.\n\n\t\t\t\tP.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)\n\n\t\tFlight 784 now boarding at gate...\n\n\tSuddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the\n\n\tmonotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn\n\n\tto see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face\n\n\taverted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago\n\n\tHulls Sports Duffle Bag.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. PONYTAIL\n\n\t\tWATCH IT!\n\n\tYOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and\n\n\tthe man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.\n\n\tJust then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, \"NOOOOOOOOO!\"\n\n\tYOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as\n\n\tTRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others\n\n\trunning.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks\n\n\tup at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....\n\n\t\t\t\tTERRIFIED TRAVELER\n\n\t\tJust exactly why did you volunteer?\n\n\tINT.

Extravagant paintings\n\n\tadorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his\n\n\tglasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty\n\n\tseated on folding chairs.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOET\n\n\t\tStill among the myriad microwaves, the\n\n\t\tinfra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones\n\n\t\tand zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally\n\n\t\tsmall, byte-sized now, tinier even than\n\n\t\tscience lurking in some vague electricity\n\n\t\twhere, if we listen we can hear the solitary\n\n\t\tvoice of that poet telling us,\n\n\t\t\"We are no other than a moving row\n\n\t\tOf Magic shadow-shapes that come and go\n\n\t\tRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold\n\n\t\tIn Midnight by the Master of the show.\"\n\n\tAs the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE\n\n\tJUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.

POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING\n\n\tCOLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his\n\n\tankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\n\t\tWhere are you taking me?\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN #1\n\n\t\tSouth of France, buddy.

CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY\n\n\tA Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen\n\n\tprisoners, crawls through a busy street.

COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)\n\n\tFierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.

HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)\n\n\tCOLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the\n\n\tlarge room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where\n\n\tlight pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON\n\n\tCOMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.\n\n\tPATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily\n\n\tat the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.\n\n\tBILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,\n\n\ta twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLINGS\n\n\t\tJeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.\n\n\t\tWhyncha show James around?

I'll\n\n\t\tgive him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.\n\n\tAs BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\n\t\tKid around, kid around.  It makes them feel\n\n\t\tgood, we're all pals.  We're prisoners, they're\n\n\t\tthe guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?\n\n\tCOLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are\n\n\tplaying cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\n\t\tHere's the games.  Games vegitize you.\n\n\t\tIf you play the games, you're\n\n\t\tvoluntarily taking a tranquilizer.\n\n\tCOLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,\n\n\tTHE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\n\t\tWhat'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How\n\n\t\tmuch?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\n\t\tI need to make a telephone call.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\n\t\tA telephone call?  That's communication\n\n\t\twith the outside world!  Doctor's\n\n\t\tdiscretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts\n\n\t\tcould just make phone calls, it could\n\n\t\tspread.  Insanity oozing through telephone\n\n\t\tcables, oozing into the ears of all those\n\n\t\tpoor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos\n\n\t\teverywhere!  A plague of madness.\n\n\t\t\t(suddenly sly and confidential)\n\n\t\tIn fact, very few of us here are actually\n\n\t\tmentally ill.  I'm not saying you're\n\n\t\tnot mentally ill, for all I know you're\n\n\t\tcrazy as a loon.  But that's not why\n\n\t\tyou're here.  Why you're here is because\n\n\t\tof the system, because of the economy.\n\n\t\t\t(indicating the TV)\n\n\t\tThere's the TV.  It's all right there.\n\n\t\tCommercials.  We are not productive\n\n\t\tanymore, they don't need us to make\n\n\t\tthings anymore, it's all automated.  What\n\n\t\tare we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay,\n\n\t\tbuy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.\n\n\t\tBut if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you\n\n\t\tknow what?  You're mentally ill! That's\n\n\t\ta fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet\n\n\t\tpaper, new cars, computerized blenders,\n\n\t\telectrically operated sexual devices...\n\n\t\t\t(getting hysterical)\n\n\t\tSCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN\n\n\t\tRADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH\n\n\t\tBRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-\n\n\t\tACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...\n\n\tA woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.\n\n\t\t\t\tTERRY\n\n\t\tTake it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.\n\n\tAbruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and\n\n\tcontinues, completely calm now.  But COLE isn't listening.  He's\n\n\tmesmerized by the TV.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\n\t\tSo if you want to watch a particular\n\n\t\tprogram, say \"All My Children\" or\n\n\t\tsomething, you go to the Charge Nurse\n\n\t\tand tell her what day and time the show\n\n\t\tyou want to see is on.  But you have to\n\n\t\ttell her before the show is scheduled\n\n\t\tto be on.  There was this one guy who\n\n\t\twas always requesting shows that had already\n\n\t\tplayed.  He couldn't quite grasp the\n\n\t\tidea that the Charge Nurse couldn't\n\n\t\tjust make it be yesterday for him, turn\n\n\t\tback time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!\n\n\tThis last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and\n\n\the turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\n\t\tSeriously, more and more people are\n\n\t\tbeing defined now as mentally ill.  Why?\n\n\t\tBecause they're not consuming on their\n\n\t\town.  But as patients, they becone\n\n\t\tconsumers of mental health care.  And\n\n\t\tthis gives the so-called sane people work!\n\n\t\t\t(hysteria again)\n\n\t\tWHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!\n\n\t\tHALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!\n\n\t\tIGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!

Disoriented.\n\n\tWhich world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,\n\n\toccasional MOANS.

On the screen is\n\n\ta slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in\n\n\tapparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained\n\n\tby PEASANTS.

Using unfamiliar words and\n\n\t\tspeaking in a strange accent, the man made\n\n\t\tdire prognostications about a pestilence\n\n\t\twhich he predicted would wipe out humanity\n\n\t\tin approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and\n\n\t\thysterical, the man raped a young woman of the\n\n\t\tvillage, was taken into custody, but then\n\n\t\tmysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.\n\n\tWE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern\n\n\tin a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the\n\n\tengraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing\n\n\tscenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an\n\n\taudience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAILLY (cont.)\n\n\t\tIn 1841, Mackay wrote, \"During seasons\n\n\t\tof great pestilence, men have often\n\n\t\tbelieved the prophecies of crazed\n\n\t\tfanatics, that the end of the world was\n\n\t\tcome.\"  Obviously, this plague/doomsday\n\n\t\tscenario is considerably more compelling\n\n\t\twhen reality supports it in some form,\n\n\t\twhether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,\n\n\t\tor AIDS.

While I was\n\n\t\tinstitutionalized, my brain was studied\n\n\t\texhaustively in the guise of mental health.\n\n\t\tI was interrogated, x-rayed, studied\n\n\t\tthoroughly.  Then, everything about me\n\n\t\twas entered into a computer where they\n\n\t\tcreated a model of my mind.\n\n\tThey all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY.  Is he\n\n\tserious?  Is he crazy?  Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY (cont.)\n\n\t\tThen, using the computer model, they\n\n\t\tgenerated every thought I could possibly\n\n\t\thave in the next, say ten years, which\n\n\t\tthey then filtered through a probability\n\n\t\tmatrix to determine everything I was\n\n\t\tgoing to do in that period.  So you\n\n\t\tsee, she knew I was going to lead the\n\n\t\tArmy of the Twelve Monkeys into the\n\n\t\tpages of history before it ever even\n\n\t\toccurred to me.  She knows everything\n\n\t\tI'm ever going to do before I know it\n\n\t\tmyself.  How about that?\n\n\tJEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\n\t\tNow I have to get going -- do my part.\n\n\t\tYou guys check all this stuff out and\n\n\t\tload up the van.  Make sure you have\n\n\t\teverything.  I'm outta here.\n\n\tJEFFREY exits.  The others stare at the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tFALE\n\n\t\tHe's seriously crazy -- you know that.\n\n\tEXT.
