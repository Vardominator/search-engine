MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING\n\n          We don't see the DRIVER, only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip-\n\n          ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked. The wheel\n\n          cranks right as the car turns onto a -\n\n          One way street. A minivan flies right at us. The Mustang\n\n          hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and -\n\n          Garbage explodes like confetti. The wipers engage, brushing\n\n          the trash aside. The car whips another turn and\n\n          EXT.

As he rushes to the front\n\n          door, we see the urgent package he is delivering.\n\n          TWO LARGE PIZZAS\n\n          Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15-\n\n          YEAR-OLDS stare out.\n\n                          15-YEAR-OLD\n\n           That's 34 minutes.

Deal?\n\n          The kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some\n\n          cash. Will snatches it and heads off.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I'll see you in like 20 minutes.\n\n          The kids look uncertain. As if sensing this, Will stops\n\n          before getting into his ride.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           You boys like Budweiser, right?\n\n                          15-YEAR-OLD\n\n           Uh, yeah, totally.\n\n                          OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD\n\n           Love that shit!\n\n          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING\n\n          The sun sets. Will cruises back into his own middle-class\n\n          town in suburban Maryland.\n\n          A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat.\n\n          Will stops at a light. Checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING in\n\n          the Jeep beside him. She catches him looking, rolls her\n\n          eyes. The light turns and the Jeep skids away.\n\n          Will self consciously removes his \"Giorgio's\" cap.\n\n          INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT\n\n          Will enters and nods at CHRISTOPHER (40s), the manager. His\n\n          balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day's\n\n          worth of pizza grease.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Yo, Chris.

I mean, the part where I\n\n           had to drop off all those pizzas\n\n           kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.\n\n           4.\n\n                          CHRISTOPHER\n\n           Oh, yeah? 'Cause, I got some kids\n\n           calling in saying you ripped them off.\n\n           Promised to buy them beer or something.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I actually did buy the beer, but it\n\n           would have been illegal to give it\n\n           to them, right? So I'm gonna do the\n\n           responsible thing and drink it myself.\n\n                          CHRISTOPHER\n\n           That's real funny. But I'm trying\n\n           to run a business here.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           What kind of business promises to\n\n           deliver anywhere in 30 minutes?\n\n           It's ridiculous.\n\n                          CHRISTOPHER\n\n           I don't wanna hear another one of\n\n           your bullshit excuses. You're fired.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Come on. If I didn't need this job,\n\n           I wouldn't be doing this shitty job.\n\n          Chris is unmoving.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Fuck! Whatever!\n\n          Will storms off. As he gets to the door -\n\n                          CHRISTOPHER\n\n           You know, you were an okay driver\n\n           half the time. And you're not a Puerto\n\n           Rican. Which means something to me.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           That's poignant.\n\n                          CHRISTOPHER\n\n           I guess I could rehire you, on a\n\n           provisional basis. Of course, this\n\n           would be at the slightly reduced\n\n           \"new company rate.\"\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Are you fucking serious?\n\n                          CHRISTOPHER\n\n           I don't know. Is there anyone else\n\n           left in town for you to work for?\n\n           5.\n\n          Will shakes his head. Swallows what's left of his pride.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           When do I start?\n\n          EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n          Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty\n\n          can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.\n\n          He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits\n\n          in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He\n\n          makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who\n\n          was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges\n\n          herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye\n\n          kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.\n\n          The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET\n\n          (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection.\n\n          He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming\n\n          Outkast's \"Ms. Jackson.\" He stops when he notices Will in\n\n          the shadows.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           What the hell?

You know,\n\n           the kiss. Putting your tongue in\n\n           her mouth right after you fucked it.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure\n\n           me on a weeknight, in her car no\n\n           less...I'm not gonna make her feel\n\n           like an untouchable.

To wash the taste of\n\n           yourself out of your mouth.\n\n          Will offers his beer. Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           By the way, she said she had a friend.\n\n           Maybe we can go on our first double\n\n           date since you tried to talk Jackie\n\n           Fortunato and her cousin into having\n\n           a four-way with us.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I misread their body language. It\n\n           happens.\n\n           6.\n\n          Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Come on. Let's go inside, drink\n\n           your beer and watch shit get crazy.\n\n                          (FANS MOVIES)\n\n           Old favorites. You choose.

Clears some magazines\n\n          to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover -\n\n          It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays,\n\n          a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the\n\n          glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young.\n\n          Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at\n\n          high school graduation, looking just as young. They have\n\n          their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will\n\n          and the girl look very high and very happy.\n\n          Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table\n\n          debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Fuck.\n\n          INT. MUSTANG - DAY\n\n          Will jumps in and starts the engine.

Loud,\n\n          dumb laughter echoes.\n\n          Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy\n\n          in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt. On his left bicep\n\n          is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Fruit motherfuckin' salad!\n\n           8.\n\n          Crouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in a wool\n\n          surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another\n\n          watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified\n\n          into saucers by his thick glasses. There's a peculiar\n\n          eagerness to please in them.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           This one's gonna blow even bigger.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Boy, if you weren't such a skinny\n\n           little bitch you coulda been in the\n\n           military or something.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Whatever.

And cut my own hair.\n\n          Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns\n\n          and pulls out a detonator.

And\n\n           in the back seat, Jay...was you.\n\n           Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Wow. I didn't know you dreamt about\n\n           me, Dwayne.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           It was only this once, Jay. To be\n\n           honest, I didn't know what to make\n\n           of it. So I consulted my dream book,\n\n           and found out it means this: you're\n\n           my road dog. You got my back.\n\n                          (MORE)\n\n           17.\n\n                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)\n\n           That's why I want to make you my\n\n           partner.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           In what?\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           In crime. And business. You see, it\n\n           ain't just about the inheritance money.\n\n           It's about what I'm gonna do with it.\n\n          Dwayne leans across the table.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I'm about to clue you in on something.\n\n           And then you'll understand the true\n\n           magnitude of what's at stake here.\n\n           Are you ready?\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Yes. I'm totally ready.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Then answer me this...what's this\n\n           town missing? I'll give you a hint.\n\n           It's a cash business, crawling with\n\n           sexy bitches.\n\n                          JAY\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           A Chinese food restaurant?\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           No. A tanning salon.\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           Think about it. All that green.\n\n           All that brown flesh.\n\n          Jay nods, thinking about. He smiles.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           It's also the perfect front for a\n\n           prostitution ring.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Yeah, of course. Because of the booths.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Yes. And because of the bitches.\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           It can all be ours. 30 percent for\n\n           you, 70 percent for me. You just\n\n           gotta help me out here.\n\n           18.\n\n          Jay looks conflicted. Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I'm starting to wonder if my dream\n\n           book was wrong about you. Maybe you\n\n           sitting behind me doesn't mean you're\n\n           my road dog. Maybe it means you're\n\n           plotting to stab me in the back,\n\n           like some snake in the grass.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           That's crazy. I'd never do something\n\n           like that. The dream book was right!\n\n          Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing...\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Ok. I'll do it. But I'm not shooting\n\n           him or anything. I'll hold him while\n\n           you shoot him. That's it.\n\n          Dwayne chuckles.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Here's a fact: they don't build prisons\n\n           for criminals, they build them for\n\n           idiots. Shit, they got three different\n\n           types of CSI on TV, just laying out\n\n           how the police do their business...and\n\n           still, idiots like you think you can\n\n           just go out and do a murder yourself.\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           If you wanna be a millionaire, you\n\n           gotta think like one. And\n\n           millionaires don't kill people.\n\n           They hire assassins. Which I did.\n\n           We gotta pay him on Tuesday.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           What? Why would you do that?\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I was presented with an opportunity.\n\n           I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a\n\n           highly trained assassin is a steal.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           But we don't have that kinda money.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Now we're addressing the real problem:\n\n           how do we get the 100 grand? 'Cause\n\n           once we get that, we get the million.\n\n                          (MORE)\n\n           19.\n\n                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)\n\n           And once we get the million, we will\n\n           literally own this town and every\n\n           single thing in it.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           I guess we could just...rob a bank.\n\n           One of these local banks with nothing\n\n           but a dipshit security guard.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Again, not quite thinking like a\n\n           millionaire.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Okay, then let's hire someone to rob\n\n           a bank.\n\n          Dwayne thinks about this for a second.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Fuck hiring them, we could just force\n\n           someone to rob a bank for us. Like\n\n           with blackmail, or death threats, or -\n\n                          JAY\n\n                          (ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY)\n\n           A bomb. Everyone's scared of a bomb.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I was gonna say hypnotism...but I\n\n           like that. It's out of the fucking\n\n           box. We just strap one to some\n\n           motherfucker's chest, like we did to\n\n           those watermelons. Think you can\n\n           you build some kinda bomb vest?\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Yeah, I mean...camel jockeys do it\n\n           in caves. I got a garage workshop.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I'm pretty sure this is exactly how\n\n           a millionaire would do it. And the\n\n           beauty of it is: we don't lose any\n\n           sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Except The Major.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Yeah. The Major dies. But no one\n\n           gets hurt.\n\n          Dwayne smiles. But a nagging thought interrupts him -\n\n           20.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           There's just one problem. Where do\n\n           we get our guy? 'Cause if we do a\n\n           kidnapping, then we're right back\n\n           where we started...doing shit that's\n\n           gonna get us caught.\n\n                          (MIND WORKING)\n\n           What we need is someone to come to\n\n           us...to a place where we can control\n\n           the situation. Someone without any\n\n           connection to us.\n\n          The guys stare at each other, stumped. Until something\n\n          catches Dwayne's attention...a local commercial playing on\n\n          the flat-screen. A PIZZA CHEF slides a pizza into a box -\n\n                          PIZZA CHEF\n\n                          (ON TV)\n\n           We'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes\n\n           or less!

CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n          A hand grabs a beer from the fridge.\n\n           VOICE (O.S.)\n\n           You're not trying to draw a psycho\n\n           pension...you really are crazy!\n\n          Will heads into the living room with the beer. The voice\n\n          belongs to Danny Glover. The guys are watching Lethal Weapon.\n\n          Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just stopped Riggs (Mel Gibson)\n\n          from killing himself. Riggs looks at him, crazily, before -\n\n                          RIGGS\n\n                          (ON TV)\n\n           I'm hungry. I'm gonna get something\n\n           to eat.\n\n          Chet looks over at Will. He is drunk, and in a dark mood.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Maybe you should pace yourself.\n\n           It's noon on a Saturday.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Fridge is full, man.

You\n\n           remember Tom Small?\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Yeah, he used to kick our asses.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Turns out he was probably jerking\n\n           off to it afterwards. He's gay.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           I hope he chokes on a dick. I never\n\n           liked him.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Your sister did. She let him finger\n\n           blast her.

That's pretty cute.\n\n          Chet chuckles. Will ignores him, sips his beer.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           The point I'm trying to make is this:\n\n           Tom Small was an asshole. He was\n\n           totally wrong for your sister. Just\n\n           like every other guy she's ever dated.\n\n           Right through to that Mark dude she's\n\n           gonna get back together with.

Why the fuck are we talking\n\n           about who my sister goes out with?\n\n          At a loss, Will shrugs. Chet turns back to the TV, presses\n\n          play. Lethal Weapon resumes. Something blows up. Chet\n\n          pauses the movie and stares at Will for a beat.\n\n           22.\n\n                          CHET\n\n          You sneaky son of a bitch...you want\n\n          to fuck my sister, don't you?\n\n                          WILL\n\n          Chet, I really don't...\n\n                          CHET\n\n          My twin sister!?

CHET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n          Will screeches away in his car.\n\n          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          A day or so has passed. Will sits on his couch, an unshaven\n\n          mess, watching Lethal Weapon 2. Murtaugh and Riggs laugh\n\n          and joke around. Best buds.\n\n          Will looks like he might cry. He goes for his beer, knocks\n\n          it over. He stares at the growing puddle of beer...then\n\n          grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them\n\n          to sop it up.\n\n          INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT\n\n          Will sits at a table, looking out through the misty window.\n\n          Christopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him.\n\n                          CHRISTOPHER\n\n           Come on, wake up and get to work.\n\n          Christopher hands him the order slip.

It's 30 minutes\n\n           away or the pizza comes out of your\n\n           paycheck. Tick tock.\n\n          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n          Will's Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway.\n\n          The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into\n\n          the distance.\n\n          EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n          The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway. Overgrown\n\n          shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view. All that\n\n          Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the\n\n          sky, beacon light flashing atop it.\n\n          Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate.\n\n          EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT\n\n          The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway. Will gets out.\n\n          There is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio\n\n          tower built on top of a small office structure.\n\n           27.\n\n          The office door is ajar. Florescent light glows from inside.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Hello?\n\n           DWAYNE (O.S.)\n\n           (calling back from beyond door)\n\n           Hey, bud! Sorry for the hike! The\n\n           county's got us doing repairs at the\n\n           ass end of the night!\n\n          This puts Will at ease. He heads toward the office. As he\n\n          gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. It is Dwayne\n\n          WEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK\n\n                          WILL\n\n           What the -\n\n          Will hears something behind him and whirls around -\n\n          To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Holy fuck!\n\n          Will makes a run for it. But the guys are on top of him in\n\n          no time. He madly fights them off and dashes for his car.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Stop! We got a gun, you asshole!\n\n          Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Fuck! Get him!\n\n          Jay is right on Will's tail. Without breaking stride, Jay\n\n          picks up a large branch and wings it at him.\n\n          Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps\n\n          on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will's body.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           What the hell!?\n\n           (at a loss)\n\n           Rape!\n\n          Jay wrestles something from his pocket. A chloroform soaked\n\n          rag. He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose.\n\n          Will soon goes limp.\n\n          Dwayne appears, looming above them. He pulls his gorilla\n\n          mask back and smiles.\n\n           28.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Step one.\n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n          Blurry vision coming into focus. Two gorillas.\n\n          EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY\n\n          Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous\n\n          now. Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at\n\n          his captors. His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his\n\n          back. He wears his \"Giorgio's\" cap and a buttoned up olive\n\n          green Army jacket.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           You thought we were gonna rape you.\n\n                          (CHUCKLES)\n\n           Idiot.\n\n          Will mumbles something through the duct tape.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Just shut up. The tape is there for\n\n           a reason. 'Cause this next part is\n\n           gonna take a measure of calm. Are\n\n           you with me? Can you be calm?\n\n          Will nods. Dwayne holds up his driver license.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever-\n\n           The-Fuck Street, right now you are\n\n           wearing an explosive vest.\n\n          Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get\n\n          his hands loose so he can tear it open.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Calm the fuck down!\n\n          Will stiffens. For emphasis, Dwayne reveals the gun tucked\n\n          down the front of his pants like a big metal cock.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Now stay still and my associate will\n\n           show you.\n\n          Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket. Will is, in fact,\n\n          wearing an explosive vest. It is a cobbled together but\n\n          intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored\n\n          wires. There is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital\n\n          display and a keypad.\n\n          Will begins to hyperventilate.\n\n           29.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Take it easy, man. You're fine. I\n\n           built this thing. It's pretty stable.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           For a fucking bomb. So don't trip\n\n           over your shoelaces or anything.\n\n           That thing's full of C-4. And the C\n\n           is for chaos.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Actually, the C stands for \"composite.\"\n\n           But, yeah, I'd try not to slam into\n\n           stuff.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Can I take that tape off now, pizza boy?\n\n          Will nods. Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Help!\n\n          Dwayne chuckles.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           You know where you are?

BATHROOM, CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n          The door is shut. Will sits on the toilet lid. He has the\n\n          jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest.\n\n          The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. The\n\n          wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated,\n\n          purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it.\n\n          Will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he\n\n          can slide the vest off...no luck.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           It's too tight!\n\n          He is calling off toward the\n\n                         KITCHEN\n\n          Where Chet is crouched in a corner, at the furthest point in\n\n          the furthest room from the bathroom. He uses his laptop to\n\n          look for websites on disarming a bomb.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           What if we try to separate your\n\n           shoulder?\n\n           42.\n\n           WILL (O.S.)\n\n           Fuck you!\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Well, all these sites say different\n\n           shit. There's not a lot of consensus\n\n           in the bomb disarming community.\n\n          Will emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket back on.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           This is pointless.\n\n          Chet shuts his laptop.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           I agree.

For all I\n\n           know, they're outside right now.\n\n           They see the cops show up, they blow\n\n           the vest and cut their losses.\n\n          Will stares at Chet, hopelessly overwhelmed.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           What do I do, man? What do I do now?\n\n                          CHET\n\n           I don't know, Will...I guess you\n\n           gotta rob the bank.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I haven't been inside a bank in three\n\n           years!

I'm gonna blow up!\n\n           That's way worse than getting stabbed\n\n           or shot. At least some people survive\n\n           that.

He turns and looks out the windshield:\n\n          they're parked in the Walmart lot, watching the store entrance.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I wish he would hurry his shit up.\n\n           48.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           You worried about that other guy\n\n           he's with?\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           No, man. He picked him up at a\n\n           school. So long as there ain't any\n\n           cops, he can take the whole town\n\n           with him. I just want my money.\n\n          Dwayne surveys the area. Something catches his attention:\n\n          the bland strip mall across the street. There's a Blockbuster,\n\n          Subway, and an empty space in between. Dwayne smiles.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           What? You want me to run over to\n\n           Subway, get us a couple sandwiches?\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           If you had any vision, Jay, you'd\n\n           know exactly what I'm thinking about\n\n           right now. And it's not a sandwich.\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           Look how well trafficked that shopping\n\n           mall is.

Sounds like a demotion, I\n\n           know, but it's an important position.\n\n           Because we're gonna be using code\n\n           words and shit. For example, if a\n\n           customer walks in and says he wants a\n\n           tan, that just means he wants a tan.\n\n           But if he says he wants a \"deluxe\n\n           tan,\" that means a blow job and you\n\n           gotta get one of the girls in there\n\n           to suck him off. You with me?\n\n                          JAY\n\n           So far. But what if he wants a fuck?\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           There's gonna be codes for everything:\n\n           missionary, anal, black chicks. I\n\n           got it all written down back home in\n\n           my files.\n\n                          (MORE)\n\n           49.\n\n                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)\n\n           I'm not gonna bother getting into it\n\n           with you right now, because you're\n\n           supposed to be on lookout and you're\n\n           no good at multitasking.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Okay. 'Cause they're about to get\n\n           away.\n\n          Dwayne spots the Mustang pulling away.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Fuck.\n\n          He throws the van into gear.\n\n          INT.

No way! We've got a car.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Yeah, my car. I'm not gonna use it\n\n           as a getaway vehicle. They can trace\n\n           the plates.

The\n\n           Fishers. Remember how they used to\n\n           pay us to clean their garage? They\n\n           leave the keys in there. And they\n\n           have a Datsun.

My dad moved away after your\n\n           big mouth ruined his marriage and\n\n           humiliated him, and no one wanted to\n\n           hang out with the mom who everyone\n\n           knew fucked a lifeguard.\n\n           51.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           You never should have told me! I\n\n           was 13 years old. I couldn't process\n\n           that kind of information. I had to\n\n           tell someone else.\n\n           (shakes his head)\n\n           Fuck. I really am sorry about it.\n\n           Okay?

I'm sorry...I'm sorry that my\n\n           family was going through a rough patch\n\n           and I was smoking a ton of weed and\n\n           listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the\n\n           time. And that I needed some extra\n\n           dough to indulge my habit. Which, in\n\n           hindsight, was probably just a cry\n\n           for help. But you never even noticed.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Thanks. Now I feel even worse.\n\n          Will sits there, stewing for a moment. Then he softens -\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I shouldn't have stolen the ball. I\n\n           knew it was wrong and I regretted it\n\n           like the next day. I actually tried\n\n           to buy it back but the guy wanted\n\n           twice as much. I had to smoke even\n\n           more weed just to get past the whole\n\n           shitty incident. I guess that's why\n\n           they call it a downward spiral.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           I appreciate that you tried to buy\n\n           it back.

Will\n\n          nervously takes a look. There is only a small amount of\n\n          blood.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           It's just a flesh wound.

Sorry, Cruz.\n\n          Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20-\n\n          something girl, and helps her up off the ground. He checks\n\n          her name tag: SANDRA.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Hey, Sandra. I know you're probably\n\n           scared right now, but if you go grab\n\n           us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out\n\n           of here. This will all be over and\n\n           you'll be fine. You trust me?\n\n          Sandra nods. Chet smiles, reassuringly. She hurries behind\n\n          the counter, starts filling a bank bag with cash, as -\n\n                          FAT MAN\n\n           My leg really hurts!\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Can you please hurry up, Sandra!?\n\n          Sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag.\n\n          Will grabs it. He takes a last look at the people spread\n\n          across the floor.\n\n           67.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I'm really sorry, everyone. I know\n\n           we probably fucked up your day.\n\n           (looks to Fat Man)\n\n           I'm thinking of you in particular,\n\n           sir. Actually, you know what...\n\n          Will crosses to the Fat Man, offers the bank bag.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Quickly. Peel a few bills. On me.\n\n           Anyone rats him to the cops and I'm\n\n           coming for you. I remember faces.\n\n          The Fat Man hesitantly reaches for the bag. Opens it -\n\n          Red Dye explodes all over his face. He shrieks. Chet whirls\n\n          on the teller.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           What the fuck was that about, Sandra?\n\n           I thought we had something going!\n\n           What happened to trust?\n\n                          SANDRA\n\n           I'm sorry! They make us do it!\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Could you kindly fill another bag?\n\n           Not a bank bag. A fucking garbage\n\n           bag. And Luis, will you watch her\n\n           this time?\n\n          Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet. He dumps\n\n          out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches\n\n          closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Okay. That should be enough.\n\n          Chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will. They are\n\n          home free, until -\n\n          They hear the wail of approaching sirens outside. They stop\n\n          cold, panicked. Will whirls on the Tellers.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Fuck! Which one of you assholes tripped\n\n           the alarm!?

He pushed the\n\n           button when you guys came in!\n\n          Another teller, MARK, looks up from the floor.\n\n           68.\n\n                          MARK\n\n           Sandra, you bitch!

Sandra is crying, thinking she will\n\n          probably get shot now.\n\n          Chet grabs Will and pulls him toward the door.\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Let's just get the fuck out of here.\n\n          The guys slam through the doors, out into\n\n          EXT.

Will\n\n          and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off.\n\n          OFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser\n\n          and levels his gun.

In the distance,\n\n          they hear the sirens of more cops approaching.

He moves to Chet, unclicks his belt and helps him down.\n\n          EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\n\n          Will emerges from the overturned car. He drags Chet out,\n\n          along with the bag of cash. He glances up to see the OFFICER\n\n          who crashed into them stumbling out of his own ruined car,\n\n          which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser. Another\n\n          cruiser races to the scene.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Oh, fuck, man.

MCDONALD'S - DAY\n\n          Dwayne and Jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread\n\n          out. Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on\n\n          his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I remember the summer after my mother\n\n           passed was the first year they had\n\n           the Monopoly game at McDonald's. I\n\n           musta come here three times a day\n\n           trying to collect all the game pieces.\n\n           Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from\n\n           all the grease. The Major said I was\n\n           the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he\n\n           ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care,\n\n           I just wanted to win the money and\n\n           get the fuck out of there. So, one\n\n           night, I followed this skinny register\n\n           kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling\n\n           on him, asking him where they were\n\n           hiding the Park Place piece. The\n\n           million dollar prize. But he didn't\n\n           know shit. A year later, The Major\n\n           won the lotto. I asked him for a\n\n           Sega Genesis. He bought me one of\n\n           those paddles with the ball attached.\n\n           78.\n\n          Dwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a\n\n          handful of Jay's.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I'm not ashamed to admit that I've\n\n           gone through some dark times since\n\n           then.

I know you must think that's\n\n           pretty silly, especially since you\n\n           manage to get through the day and you\n\n           don't got shit going on as compared\n\n           to me.

Chet goes for\n\n          another swing, when -\n\n          Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing.\n\n          Will grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and\n\n          flings her away.

She splashes water on her face, then enters a stall.\n\n          The bathroom door opens and Dwayne and Jay enter. Dwayne\n\n          pulls something hairy from his pocket.\n\n          Inside the stall, Kate reaches for some toilet paper...from\n\n          underneath the barrier, she notices two pairs of dirty,\n\n          masculine sneakers. Her breath goes shallow. She takes out\n\n          her cell, quietly opens it. She presses the first 9 in \"911,\"\n\n          but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull,\n\n          electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom.\n\n           DWAYNE (O.S.)\n\n           Why don't you just slide the phone\n\n           under the door, so I don't have to\n\n           kick it open and see you with your\n\n           panties down.\n\n           91.\n\n          Kate slides the phone out. One of the sneakers crushes it.\n\n          She gets off the toilet, arranges her clothing and steps out\n\n          out of the stall. She gasps at -\n\n          The two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks.

Almost imperceptibly, The Major\n\n          repositions the hand with the pen in it. Vaughn is about to\n\n          squeeze the trigger -\n\n          But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is\n\n          actually a pen gun. It fires a .22 caliber round into Vaughn's\n\n          neck. He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood.\n\n          The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to\n\n          the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck.\n\n                          MAJOR\n\n           I'll ride you all the way to hell!\n\n           I know exactly how to get there!\n\n          Vaughn reaches for his gun.

You can't kill\n\n           me!

Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to\n\n          stop and look out at him like guard dogs.\n\n          Vaughn ransacks the place. He finds a desk drawer locked.\n\n          Takes out his gun and blows it open.\n\n          Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer. Flips\n\n          through it. It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the\n\n          tanning salon, etc.\n\n                          VAUGHN\n\n           Motherfucker has lost his mind...\n\n          He finds a map of the town in the file.

He stops before leaving\n\n          the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of\n\n          his gun. Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop\n\n          onto the floor.

Come on.\n\n          Chet grabs the bag of cash. They hustle into the car and it\n\n          peels out, leaving behind a swirling cloud of dust. As the\n\n          sun begins to set -\n\n          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 58 minutes...\n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT.

SENTRA - NIGHT - MOVING\n\n          Vaughn holds up Dwayne's map as he drives. He seems to be\n\n          on the right road, headed for the radio tower. He crumples\n\n          the map and throws it in back.\n\n          EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n          The Mustang stops by the gate to the radio tower. Chet jumps\n\n          out and disappears into the bushes.\n\n          EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT\n\n          The Mustang pulls up. Will gets out and looks around the\n\n          deserted place. He holds up the money bag.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I'm here!\n\n          In the shadow of the nearby shed, the minivan is revealed as\n\n          its interior lights come on. The door opens and Dwayne\n\n          emerges, in his mask.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           How much time you got left?\n\n           97.\n\n          Will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground.

You're wasting time.\n\n          Will grips the bag close to him.\n\n          Dwayne whistles. The minivan door opens and Jay steps out.\n\n          Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop.\n\n          A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe-\n\n          like device in his hand.\n\n          Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van.\n\n          They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him.\n\n                          KATE\n\n           Will, are you there?\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I'm here.

But you should know, my\n\n           associate over there is packing a\n\n           flamethrower.\n\n          Jay aims the metal device he has been holding. He hits a\n\n          button and a pilot light comes on.\n\n           98.\n\n                          JAY\n\n                          (FLAT)\n\n           Just do what we say.

Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes\n\n          her behind him.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           Get back.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I gave you the girl.

The timer freezes and the lock at\n\n          the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the\n\n          vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it.\n\n          His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat.\n\n          Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to\n\n          Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           It's so fucking pretty, ain't it?\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Yeah. It's awesome.\n\n           99.\n\n          Dwayne looks up at Will.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Okay, you can get out of here now.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I actually have this sneaking\n\n           suspicion that once we turn around,\n\n           you're gonna put a bullet in both of\n\n           our backs - and this is just a guess -\n\n           burn our bodies.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           They say great minds think alike.\n\n           And in this case, so do we.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I figured as much. That's why I got\n\n           a gun pointed at you, too.\n\n                          (LOUDLY)\n\n           I got a sniper in the bushes locked\n\n           on you right now.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Do I look that dumb?\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I can't tell, you're wearing a mask.\n\n          Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something\n\n          shining in his eyes.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Hey...on your forehead.\n\n          Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red\n\n          dot that dances on his forehead.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Son of a bitch. Well played.\n\n          In the bushes, hidden from sight, Chet carefully aims his\n\n          laser pointer at Dwayne's forehead.\n\n          Will grins at Dwayne.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           We're gonna walk out of here now.\n\n           If you shoot, my sniper shoots. I\n\n           can't guarantee he'll get both of\n\n           you. But he'll definitely get you.\n\n          As Will turns away -\n\n           100.\n\n           VAUGHN (O.S.)\n\n           Hold the fuck up.\n\n          Vaughn emerges from the darkness. He looks at Will.\n\n                          VAUGHN\n\n           Wasn't expecting to see you here.\n\n          Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the\n\n          butt of his gun. He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn\n\n          points the gun at her and she shuts up.\n\n          Dwayne steps forward with the bag.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           It's all good. We got your money.\n\n                          VAUGHN\n\n           Nice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the\n\n           money over here.\n\n          Dwayne complies. As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the\n\n          gun at him.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Hold up. You don't have to do this.\n\n           I just paid you.\n\n          Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side.\n\n          Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.\n\n                          VAUGHN\n\n           I've been hit with a pipe, shot with a\n\n           pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking\n\n           day...all because of you and this job.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n           Just take the money.\n\n                          VAUGHN\n\n           I will. And then I'm gonna tie up the\n\n           two loose ends in the gorilla masks.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I'm not a loose end!\n\n                          VAUGHN\n\n           You're a fucking idiot. You are as\n\n           loose as ends get.\n\n          Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his\n\n          grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne's eye.\n\n          Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this.\n\n           101.\n\n                          VAUGHN\n\n           What the -\n\n          Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn't be more\n\n          surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive\n\n          ball of fire at him.\n\n          Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of\n\n                         WHICH -\n\n          Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and\n\n          knocking him off his feet.\n\n          Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the\n\n          ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries\n\n          to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's\n\n          shoulder and she whirls around to find -\n\n                          KATE\n\n           Chet!? What are you doing here!?\n\n                          CHET\n\n           Not now. We gotta take off.\n\n                          (LOOKS AROUND)\n\n           Where's Will?\n\n          Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was.\n\n          Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -\n\n          Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side. Bad news: it\n\n          keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack,\n\n          which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to\n\n          have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say,\n\n          a bullet, would cause\n\n          AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES\n\n          Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the\n\n          garbage bag.\n\n                          WILL\n\n           I got the money. Let's get the fuck\n\n           out of here.\n\n          They take off toward Will's car.\n\n          Dwayne groggily comes to...no SOUND, just a ringing. The\n\n          first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows-\n\n          what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun -\n\n          It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being\n\n          that it's out of bullets.\n\n          Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.\n\n           102.\n\n          Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him.\n\n          SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks\n\n          over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and\n\n          shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he\n\n          sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask,\n\n          frantically looks around. The money is gone.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           No!!\n\n          Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of\n\n          the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy,\n\n          he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Dwayne! Help!\n\n          Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the\n\n          driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's\n\n          face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take?\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Goddamn it, Jay!\n\n          Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it\n\n          to beat the flames down.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Stop, drop and roll!\n\n          Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames,\n\n          finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and\n\n          smothers the last of them out.\n\n          Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes.\n\n                          JAY\n\n           You came back for me...you said you\n\n           never would.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           You didn't hesitate back there, Jay.\n\n           You did good.\n\n          Jay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I'm gonna go put a bullet in that\n\n           motherfucker and get our money.\n\n           Think you can get outta here?\n\n                          JAY\n\n           Yeah. Go get him.\n\n           103.\n\n          Dwayne hurries toward the minivan. Jay stumbles up to his\n\n          feet and limps off toward the woods.\n\n          EXT.

MINIVAN - NIGHT - MOVING\n\n          Dwayne's speedometer is buried past 100 mph. His eyes burn\n\n          with intensity.\n\n           104.\n\n          INT.

HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n          An explosion rocks the minivan from inside. The back end is\n\n          lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself. It\n\n          lands on its roof and skids into a ditch.\n\n          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING\n\n          Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back\n\n          window.

DITCH - NIGHT\n\n          Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan. The shattered\n\n          windshield sprouts another crack...then another, as -\n\n          Dwayne's foot kicks it out. He drags himself from the\n\n          smoldering steel carcass. He is a charred, blood splattered\n\n          mess, but he is alive.\n\n          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n          Dwayne is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge\n\n          of consciousness. The headlights of a lone pickup truck\n\n          approach. Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride.\n\n          INT. NICE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n          The door opens and Dwayne stumbles through. He has made it\n\n          home. He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut.\n\n          From where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees\n\n          something odd...long red streaks. He crawls forward on all\n\n          fours to investigate...\n\n          It is a trail of sticky red blood. Dwayne follows it until\n\n          he comes upon its source...the crumpled body of his father,\n\n          lying face down. Dwayne's face: shock and confusion and joy.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Dad?\n\n          Dwayne inches closer, pokes the body.

His\n\n          father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he\n\n          isn't totally spent yet. He struggles to speak -\n\n                          MAJOR\n\n           Dwayne...\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           What happened to you?\n\n                          MAJOR\n\n           Some guy...said you hired him to\n\n           kill me.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Dad, I...I'd never...\n\n           107.\n\n                          MAJOR\n\n           Look at you...lip quivering like\n\n           you're getting fucked...be a man.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           I am a man!

He reaches out, cradles his father\n\n          as he expires. It's like a very bloody, white trash version\n\n          of the Pieta. Dwayne sobs uncontrollably, until -\n\n          He drops his father and pound-pound-pounds his chest in some\n\n          approximation of a life saving resuscitation.\n\n                          DWAYNE\n\n           Get up, you pussy!
