Then at the gun held\n\n              against her. She's petrified.\n\n                                  GANZ\n\n                        Stall.\n\n                                  LISA\n\n                        What do you want?\n\n                                  VANZANT\n\n                        Police business.

Sounds of movement from within\n\n              the room.\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell. Looks across at\n\n              mirror on the wall opposite. The entire lobby covered from\n\n              this spot. Every angle, including Frizzy.\n\n              ROOM\n\n              Ganz gestures to Lisa.\n\n                                  LISA\n\n                        Just a second.\n\n              Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls..Ganz goes through the\n\n              connecting door. Slips into the adjacent room.\n\n              BILLY'S ROOM\n\n              Another Hooker cowers in the corner, pulling on her clothes.\n\n              She's a Mexican girl in a ridiculous 'Indian' outfit.\n\n                                  MEXICAN GIRL\n\n                        Que paso?

He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by.\n\n                                  BILLY\n\n                               (continuing)\n\n                        When I say jump, girl, you better\n\n                        jump.\n\n                                  BILLY\n\n                               (continuing)\n\n              CORRIDOR\n\n              Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob.  Locked. Algren moves\n\n              back, preparing to kick the door down.\n\n              ADJACENT ROOM\n\n              Ganz opens the door behind the two cops. Raises his pistol\n\n              and fires. Billy's shots follow immediately. Hits Vanzant.\n\n              Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again. Wounded, he gets off\n\n              three shots, then moves inside Ganz' room. Ganz and Billy run\n\n              for the elevator... Exchange two more shots with Algren. The\n\n              Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish...\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              Cates draws his .44. Races up the stairs three at a time.\n\n              Frizzy starts to frantically call the police.\n\n              CORRIDOR\n\n              Cates stops at the landing. Vanzant's body sprawled across\n\n              the hallway. Algren back in the corridor, still losing\n\n              blood... Leans against the wall for support... Lisa staggers\n\n              out of the room, screams. Algren points the gun toward the\n\n              elevator. Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled.\n\n              Cates starts back down toward the lobby.\n\n              ELEVATOR\n\n              Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward.\n\n              Rosalie is terrified, sobbing...\n\n              CATES\n\n              Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes\n\n              the next flight in two jumps.\n\n              ELEVATOR\n\n              As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to\n\n              wait as he heads for the lobby.\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He\n\n              slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with\n\n              his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun... Cates\n\n              again slams him with his pistol, felling him...\n\n              GANZ\n\n              Slides across the floor.\n\n              CATES Senses something ... moves just as Billy appears behind\n\n              and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives\n\n              over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood.\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming... Cates'\n\n              move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for\n\n              safety... Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy\n\n              holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream.\n\n                                  GANZ\n\n                        He'll blow her goddamn head off.\n\n              Cates doesn't miss a beat. He slowly levels his .44. Takes\n\n              careful aim and starts to fire at Billy.\n\n                                  ROSALIE\n\n                        No. No.\n\n              Cates' shot narrowly misses Rosalie. The bullet smashes into\n\n              a mirror above Billy's head. Cates keeps moving closer, gun\n\n              pointed straight ahead. Billy pushes the pistol against\n\n              Rosalie'temple. For the first time, Cates hesitates. They\n\n              face each other across the length of the lobby.\n\n              ALGREN\n\n              Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. He still\n\n              holds his revolver. Dares not raise it towards Billy and\n\n              Rosalie.\n\n              BILLY BEAR\n\n              Covers Algren from near the entrance.  He's confused, doesn't\n\n              know what to do... He keeps hold of Rosalie.\n\n              GANZ\n\n              His eyes catch Algren's...\n\n                                  GANZ\n\n                        You.

Goddamn it, do it.\n\n              Cates lowers his gun. Finally lets it drop to the floor.\n\n                                  GANZ\n\n                        Kick it over here.\n\n              Cates does; Ganz picks it up, smiles, looks at Billy.\n\n                                  GANZ\n\n                               (continuing)\n\n                        Get the car.\n\n              Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with\n\n              Rosalie.\n\n                                  GANZ\n\n                               (continuing)\n\n                        Your gun's just like mine.\n\n              He's going to kill Cates. But first be glances at Algren.\n\n              Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates' .44.\n\n              Algren staggers back. Dead before he hits the floor. Cates\n\n              twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again\n\n              Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman\n\n              across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor.\n\n              Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an\n\n              attempt for Algren's gun. A bullet splatters against the\n\n              floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. The gun\n\n              skitters out of reach.\n\n                                  CATES\n\n                        You lying son of a bitch...\n\n                                  GANZ\n\n                        What are you talking about? We\n\n                        didn't kill her ...\n\n              Ganz smiles.\n\n              With your own gun, cop. How does it feel? Cates leaps into a\n\n              wooden phone booth. Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth\n\n              with both his and Cates' gun. Two bullets crash into the\n\n              booth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are\n\n              ominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance.\n\n              STREET\n\n              Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the\n\n              Cougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out. Car pulls out,\n\n              then the police cars and vans begin to arrive.\n\n              PHONE BOOTH\n\n              Chunks of wood on the floor. Shafts of light through a dozen\n\n              bullet holes. Shattered receiver dangling from a cord. Cates,\n\n              wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle. He drops to\n\n              the floor.\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              The police arrive. Swarm into the hotel. All eyes on Cates as\n\n              he rushes to Algren. Too late... Cates realizes Algren is\n\n              dead. He cradles Algren's head as he stares at the arriving\n\n              TAC Squad and Patrolmen.\n\n              TRANSITION.\n\n              SQUAD ROOM DAY\n\n              Cates walks in.

Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside...\n\n              a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and\n\n              taste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall\n\n              instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a\n\n              graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods\n\n              to the Guard at the end of the cell block.

Sprawled on a\n\n              bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond's\n\n              age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He\n\n              doesn't even look at Cates.\n\n                                  CATES\n\n                        Hammond.\n\n              Cates steps inside the cell.\n\n                                  CATES\n\n                               (continuing)\n\n                        Hammond!\n\n              No answer.

Cates next takes out his\n\n              wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the\n\n              car fender... Smiles.\n\n                                  CATES\n\n                        I guess the first thing I ought,\n\n                        to explain to you, nigger, is I\n\n                        fight dirty.\n\n              Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face.\n\n              Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates\n\n              hesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially\n\n              open car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n\n                        So do I.\n\n              Hammond aims a kick at Cates' head.  Cates blocks it with\n\n              crossed forearms, grabs, twists.  Hammond tumbles, rolls away\n\n              from Cates.  Both men struggle to their feet, circle each\n\n              other.\n\n              Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates,\n\n              a bit sooner than he expected.  Cates smiles.\n\n              Hammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more\n\n              labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates\n\n              clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater\n\n              bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a\n\n              brick wall.\n\n              Hammond is faster...\n\n              Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at\n\n              one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond's\n\n              back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the\n\n              lighter man's agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary...\n\n              Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at\n\n              his side... Breath coming like a bellows...\n\n              Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put\n\n              him out.\n\n                                  CATES\n\n                        Now, you bastard, you going to\n\n                        tell me what's going on...\n\n              Puffing away.\n\n                                  CATES\n\n                               (continuing)\n\n                        ... Do I have to kick the shit out\n\n                        of you some more.\n\n              They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and-\n\n              white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights\n\n              flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out,\n\n              guns drawn.\n\n                                  FIRST COP\n\n                        All right, you two.

Cates falls back against\n\n              the patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop\n\n              lifts Cates' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge,\n\n              shows it to the other cop.\n\n                                  FIRST COP\n\n                        What the hell's going on here?\n\n              Cates walks over, pockets his gun.\n\n                                  SECOND COP\n\n                        I've got a burglary call.

Hammond twists as Ganz\n\n              also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet\n\n              backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the\n\n              ground, looks at Cates.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n\n                        Jesus Christ, I didn't think you'd\n\n                        really do it.

A look\n\n              of childish disbelief passes over his face.\n\n                                  GANZ\n\n                        I got hit.  I can't believe it.

Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of\n\n              Ganz' now lifeless hand.
