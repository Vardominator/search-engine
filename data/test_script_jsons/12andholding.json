NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING\n\n          TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes\n\n          through a suburban neighborhood.\n\n          Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck\n\n          pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears\n\n          over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The\n\n          boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.\n\n          INT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Rudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop.\n\n          Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a\n\n          TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys\n\n          cautiously look around and whisper.\n\n                               JACOB\n\n                     You see `em?\n\n                               RUDY\n\n                     No. But that doesn't mean they're\n\n                     not here.\n\n          After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking\n\n          towards the tree house.   Jacob stays behind, eyeing their\n\n          safety.\n\n                               RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)\n\n                     Jacob, come on. It's cool.\n\n          Suddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.   It hits\n\n          Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground.\n\n          Rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and\n\n          debris come flying at him.\n\n          As Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his\n\n          mask. He quickly runs for the tree.\n\n          TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come\n\n          running out of the woods, rocks in hand.\n\n          Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are\n\n          nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a\n\n          DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and\n\n          unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.\n\n                                                                    2.\n\n          INT. TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Jacob looks back and sees Jeff and Kenny, running over. Rudy\n\n          crosses to the door with a BUCKET of liquid.\n\n                              JACOB\n\n                    What the hell is that?\n\n                              RUDY\n\n                    Piss.\n\n          Rudy dumps the piss onto Jeff and Kenny.\n\n          EXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n          Now drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree,\n\n          screaming. They try to shake the urine off.\n\n          Kenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up\n\n          to the boys.\n\n                              KENNY\n\n                    You and your deformed brother are\n\n                    dead!\n\n          INT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n          Jacob rips the hockey mask off. (A large STRAWBERRY\n\n          BIRTHMARK covers the right side of his face.) He's insulted.\n\n                              RUDY\n\n                        (calling to Kenny)\n\n                    Anytime you're ready, dickhead.\n\n          EXT.

From globs of\n\n          syrup being placed over pancakes to the mass consumption of\n\n          omelets and sausage. Caught up with eating, nobody speaks.\n\n          EST. EXT.

Once he settles on a\n\n                       texture he likes, his appetite will\n\n                       increase.\n\n                                 GRACE\n\n                       I can't believe this is happening.\n\n                                 DOCTOR\n\n                       Considering what Leonard could have\n\n                       suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he\n\n                       is severely overweight. A loss of\n\n                       appetite may be a benefit.\n\n          Grace and Patrick shoot him a look of death.\n\n                                                                  24.\n\n          INT.

Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A\n\n          beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud\n\n          CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a\n\n          smile comes to his face. He likes it.\n\n          INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME\n\n          Jacob lies in bed, holding Rudy's old baseball GLOVE.
