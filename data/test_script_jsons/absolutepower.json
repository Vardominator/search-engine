WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                   1\n\n    The saddest eyes you ever saw.\n\n    We are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for\n\n    one of his paintings.\n\n    PULL BACK TO REVEAL --\n\n    A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,\n\n    the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so\n\n    brilliantly.\n\n    Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban\n\n    housewives are there too.\n\n    And one older man.\n\n    This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly\n\n    dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a\n\n    successful company executive.\n\n    As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great\n\n    concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss\n\n    nothing: He has pilot's eyes.\n\n    We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this\n\n    is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the\n\n    hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --\n\n    Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the\n\n    eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.\n\n    Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his\n\n    work a moment, shakes his head.\n\n                                GIRL STUDENT\n\n               Don't give up.\n\n                                LUTHER\n\n               I never do.\n\n                                GIRL STUDENT\n\n               May I?\n\n    She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts\n\n    thumbing through.\n\n    The sketchbook as the pages turn.\n\n    Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The\n\n    hands are better. Very skillful.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                         2.\n\n1     CONTINUED:                                                    1\n\n      The GIRL hands it back.

The streets are clean, the\n\n      houses neat and well tended.\n\n      Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's\n\n      afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.\n\n3     INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                       3\n\n      Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working\n\n      class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man\n\n      Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They\n\n      are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.\n\n                               LUTHER\n\n                       (as they nod to\n\n                         each other)\n\n                Redhead.\n\n                                RED\n\n                Luther.\n\n                       (as Luther hands\n\n                        him a videotape)\n\n                Your life would be a whole lot\n\n                simpler if you could learn to\n\n                operate a V.C.R.\n\n                              LUTHER\n\n                My only failing.\n\n      As he turns --\n\n4     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                   4\n\n      A street of   small row houses. Clean, well tended.\n\n      Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He\n\n      carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the\n\n      market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.\n\n                                                            3.\n\n5   EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                                    5\n\n    A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door.\n\n    Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly,\n\n    bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front\n\n    door.\n\n6   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                          6\n\n    as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,\n\n    lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food\n\n    away --\n\n7   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT                    7\n\n    Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.\n\n    Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther\n\n    himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it\n\n    down.\n\n    A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley\n\n    sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on\n\n    another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan\n\n    cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.\n\n    Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.\n\n    Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a\n\n    photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little\n\n    girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands\n\n    alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at\n\n    them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.\n\n    Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks\n\n    out the window.\n\n8   POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON                                    8\n\n    is visible.     Lovely.

SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                  10\n\n     In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.\n\n     But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we\n\n     are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and\n\n     power.\n\n     We're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark.\n\n     Totally deserted. Silence.\n\n     Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO\n\n     VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The\n\n     lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides\n\n     to a stop. Again, silence...\n\n     HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There\n\n     is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now --\n\n11   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                11\n\n     A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears\n\n     dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,\n\n     begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --\n\n     -- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his\n\n     entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last\n\n     sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast,\n\n     so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught\n\n     again.\n\n12   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                        12\n\n     The grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a\n\n     backpack.\n\n     The night is cool.\n\n     He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is\n\n     a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't\n\n     gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.\n\n     One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,\n\n     in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.\n\n     He makes no sound at all.\n\n13   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                     13\n\n     Thick wood with reinforced steel.\n\n     Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens\n\n     it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer\n\n     of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a\n\n     key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the\n\n     instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:\n\n                                                             5.\n\n14   INT.

It\n\n     has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to\n\n     find out, a tiny computer.

Luther moves past\n\n      it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a\n\n      late one, when the madness had him and things were\n\n      sliding away. Very sad.\n\n      Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --\n\n      -- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an\n\n      instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as\n\n      if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if\n\n      getting ready for his next museum session  --\n\n      -- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the\n\n      third floor.\n\n27    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - THIRD-FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT          27\n\n      Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an\n\n      overpowering sense of being alone --\n\n      -- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers \"wow,\"\n\n      moves on.\n\n28    INT.

No paintings here -- instead we see\n\n      a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby\n\n      girl, the next one of the same child at three.\n\n      We watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she\n\n      is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                          8.\n\n28    CONTINUED:                                                  28\n\n      Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into,\n\n      if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret.

Christy\n\n      holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.\n\n      KEEP PULLING BACK.\n\n      And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter\n\n      is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.\n\n      Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.\n\n      Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.    Now he\n\n      moves on.\n\n29    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT              29\n\n      Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside,\n\n      closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down,\n\n      takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up.\n\n      Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied\n\n      bed.\n\n      A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver\n\n      clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop\n\n      the other, several more photos of the happy couple --\n\n      -- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a\n\n      thick leather handle.\n\n      Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large\n\n      full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.\n\n      Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself,\n\n      he's studying the mirror itself.\n\n      He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs\n\n      and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             9.\n\n29   CONTINUED:                                                   29\n\n     Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up\n\n     the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at\n\n     the large mirror, clicks once --\n\n     -- and the mirror swings silently open.\n\n     A room is revealed.
