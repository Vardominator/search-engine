SCIENTIST'S LAB - DAY\n\n          We see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be the\n\n          inner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the\n\n          scientist, in a white coat.\n\n           We pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicated\n\n          MULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with\n\n          the MACHINE. The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level\n\n          move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but\n\n          then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.\n\n          We pull back further to see the back and legs of the\n\n          DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The\n\n          regime's emblem can be seen on the uniforms.\n\n                                  DICTATOR\n\n                    Useless.\n\n                                  SCIENTIST\n\n                       Please.

SCIENTIST'S LAB - NIGHT\n\n          The grainy footage rolls again; we see the scientist moving\n\n          away from the camera (having just turned it on).\n\n          The lab is shadowy, late at night. We see his worktable for\n\n          the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously\n\n          filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor\n\n          is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the\n\n          worktable. Nearby is a small old-fashioned tiny little box.\n\n                              SCIENTIST\n\n                        (tired, but dictating to\n\n                         keep the documentary\n\n                         record complete)\n\n                    My last possible solution....\n\n                        (muttering to himself)\n\n                    It must work...\n\n          He gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though\n\n          for good luck.

The machine continues to run.\n\n          Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously.\n\n          The scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets\n\n          up and comes towards camera.\n\n          We see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us:\n\n          CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks\n\n          sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated.\n\n          Pull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new\n\n          sort of energy.

SCIENTIST'S LAB - A DAY LATER\n\n          The machine zips through the complex 3-D chess game at\n\n          lightning speed, checkmating the scientist in seconds as the\n\n          Dictator watches.\n\n          The scientist laughs fondly and pats the machine.\n\n                                 DICTATOR\n\n                      Perfect.\n\n                                SCIENTIST\n\n                          (PROUDLY)\n\n                      You see, it evolves.\n\n          The scientist proudly gives the machine to the dictator.

The machine seems to try to squirm away.\n\n          The director's BLACK-GLOVED HAND grasps it harder.\n\n           he machine, responding to the brutality, lashes an arm out\n\n          and grabs the nearest soldier (seen from the back, we see\n\n          only the uniform and helmeted head) by the back of his arm,\n\n          BREAKING his ARM.

He sees a vandalized poster of what appears\n\n          to be a dictator/leader.\n\n          9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.\n\n          Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.\n\n          9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war\n\n          Machine.\n\n           LOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.\n\n          Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a\n\n          piece of metal lying in front of him.\n\n          The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure\n\n          emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him\n\n          with all his might.\n\n          9 hits him square in the chest.

We see\n\n          that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a\n\n          contagious eagerness and imaginativeness.\n\n          2 peers eagerly at 9.

But she is unable to move or speak\n\n          and now, just as 9 could only watch 8's soul being sucked\n\n          out, 7 can only helplessly watch as the Seamstress slithers\n\n          closer and closer to its prey.
