Greasy. Pitch. Thick. Oily.\n\n   Dense. Heavy... Lapping... Slow.... A desolate canal... Night.\n\n   Onto dark stones... rain-slicked... darkest slate-grey cobbles...\n\n   And on through streets... Narrow.        Grimy.     Sooty.   Rank...\n\n   Deserted...\n\n   Pastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed, derelict\n\n   buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading\n\n   beams and rusted iron chains... Mossy, mildewed walls... Dripping\n\n   fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined\n\n   guttering...\n\n   Moving... Turning... Into a pinched, arched, alleyway -- If\n\n   anything darker, blacker... Foreboding... Forsaken...\n\n   And if we listen -- If we strain our ears -- listen -- we can\n\n   hear music -- faint. Ghostly. Haunting ... \"Take Me Back To\n\n   Dear Ol' Blighty \" as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone\n\n   bar surrounded by drunken men...\n\n   We keep moving... The music growing... In the distance a faint\n\n   glow.... Dirty-yellow, diffused, misty light... We move towards\n\n   it... Towards the piss-coloured light...\n\n   We stop... In the middle of nowhere... Dark nowhere... and the\n\n   music fades... Fades away... Vanished... Extreme silence... All we\n\n   have is all we can see...\n\n   The gable end of an old house.... Limey-light bleeding weakly\n\n   from a broken, filthy window... All is still -- suddenly it\n\n   comes crashing down -- the end wall comes crashing down - a\n\n   flurry of bricks and mortar... Crashing down... The tumble of\n\n   masonry... And through clouds of brick-dust and rubble we see\n\n   figures inside... Through a smokey powdered fog we can see a\n\n   group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house...\n\n   On the walls faded 40's wallpaper, peeling in parts to reveal\n\n   older dim patterns... damp patches... A window crudely boarded\n\n   up... A few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair\n\n   -- a 60's black vinyl, a deco-patterned smoker, a 70's cream\n\n   plastic, a brown wooden kitchen chair etc... The colours in\n\n   the room are browns, greys, caramels, darks, muted...\n\n   In the middle of the room, standing on dusty, bare wooden\n\n   floorboards, his fist clenched aggressively by his sides, is\n\n   OLD MAN PEANUT, aged 80... Skinny... Wearing a dark three piece\n\n   suit... Gold watch chain... Black Homburg... He is squaring up to\n\n   us... Staring...\n\n                                                                    3.\n\nCONTINUED: (2)\n\n   Slightly behind, to his left, sitting nonchalantly cross-\n\n   legged in a battered brown leather wingback armchair and\n\n   casually smoking a Davidoff cigarette, is MEREDITH, late\n\n   40's... Suave... Immaculate... Wearing black handmade boots, black\n\n   Saville Row suit, black cashmere roll neck sweater, herring\n\n   bone overcoat with a black velvet collar, brown leather\n\n   gloves, his jet-black hair is heavily brilliantined.... Behind\n\n   him an old wardrobe...\n\n   Standing with his back three quarters to us, and leaning on a\n\n   broken, chipped, mantelpiece over a smashed tiled fireplace\n\n   is ARCHIE, aged 52... Big... Avuncular... Wearing a car coat and\n\n   casual nondescript clothes... he is pouring himself a Captain\n\n   Morgan's rum from a bottle into a polystyrene cup... He sort\n\n   of sees us -- is not fussed -- drinks...\n\n   Standing at the back of the room, in front of a door which             *\n\n   has at some time been on fire, (it's yellowing, tobacco-ey\n\n   paint charred and blistered), is MAL, aged mid-40's... Wearing\n\n   a silver-grey suit, white shirt, duck-egg blue silk tie...\n\n   There is another man in the room but we do not see his face --\n\n   for he s its slu mpe d, h ead in his han ds in o ne of t he\n\n   armchairs - a picture of despair. He wears an olive green\n\n   shirt, brown trousers, maroon braces... This is COLIN, aged\n\n   late 40's...\n\n                                        CUT TO\n\n   Blackness and silence...\n\n   In the silent black an outsize boot appears - scuffed and\n\n   tatty... Attached to skinny legs in black tights... The legs\n\n   gangle and flip pulling into view a bony, pasty, bare torso\n\n   which is undulating oddly -- and here comes the head! - Long,\n\n   lank, shoulder length hair... Dripping from a white domed pate\n\n   - The face poker straight in contrast to the comedic body-\n\n   antics -- A grave-grey face -- Fleshy, bulbous, rubbery...\n\n   Ladies and Gentlemen -- MAX WALL!\n\n   He goon-walks about for a bit in the black space... Baboon-\n\n   bottomed... As if knees tied together... Aflickin' and akickin'\n\n   his clown boots... His unhappy face... Like death... Prancing...\n\n   Ridiculous dancing... Absurd...\n\n   Giant C/U on his morose contorted phizzog...\n\n                          MAX\n\n                    (Directly to us... darkly)\n\n              ...Evenin'!\n\n                                        CUT TO\n\n   Music...

Thousands of splinters and\n\n    shards strewn across a purple Wilton carpet... the white fur\n\n    of a luxurious sheepskin rug in bits... Ripped to shreds...

Approaching\n\n    the legs of a si deboard and see ing into the bla ckness\n\n    underneath... We can just make out the quizzical, frightened\n\n    eyes of a white poodle... We move on... Past twisted, wrecked\n\n    lampshades... Broken plates, ornaments... An up-ended vase of\n\n    half-eaten flowers... NILSSON continues his self-pitying\n\n    overwrought ballad and as he hits the massive, masochistic\n\n    chorus/crescendo we come across COLIN lying rigid on his back\n\n    in the corner of the devastated room... His shocked eyes\n\n    staring wildly... His body petrified. Paralysed... As if frozen\n\n    at the height of an epileptic fit -- Like something from\n\n    Pompeii -- Like Max Schrek as Nosferatu hit by light... We stay\n\n    on COLIN...
