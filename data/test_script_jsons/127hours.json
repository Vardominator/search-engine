Gasping for\n\n          oxygen, his legs screaming for rest, he pushes and pushes\n\n          until the crest and then down, down, instant speed and he can\n\n          suck on his water again. Part of a massive clan who define\n\n          themselves not by what they are, but by what they do. In a\n\n          way, he's an action movie personified and the opening should\n\n          be shot and cut to provide adrenaline in spadefuls.\n\n          Until...\n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT.

The bike has him trapped\n\n          on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling. He submits,\n\n          landing nose deep in the sand. He sits up, looks around\n\n          quickly to see if anyone saw. Pulls out his camera from his\n\n          bag and takes a a self-portrait snap of the mess.\n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. DESERT.

CANYON. SUNRISE.\n\n          Hundreds of miles of canyon - sunrise. The inner canyons\n\n          change from dark umbers and black shadows to immense bands of\n\n          pastel yellow, white, green and a hundred shades of red, a\n\n          hallucinogenic movement towards light.\n\n           V.O.\n\n           `Good morning America!' etc.\n\n          There's a chorus of 'Good Mornings' from American TV & radio\n\n          shows.

It's 6:45\n\n           Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The\n\n           weather is great! I figure by now\n\n           that Leona, my housemate - Hi\n\n           Leona! - has missed me hopefully\n\n           since I didn't show up last night.\n\n           Another hour and a half they'll\n\n           miss me for not showing up for\n\n           work. Hi Brion at work! Best case\n\n           scenario is they notify the police\n\n           and after a 24 hour hold they file\n\n           a report, a missing persons report.\n\n           Which means noon tomorrow it's\n\n           official that I'm gone. I do still\n\n           have the tiniest bit of water left.\n\n           Well, actually, I've resorted...I've\n\n           had a couple pretty good gulps of\n\n           urine that I saved in my Camelbak.\n\n           I sorta let it distill...it tastes\n\n           like hell. So it's 70 hours since\n\n           I left on my bike from Horseshoe\n\n           Trailhead during which time I have\n\n           consumed 3 liters of water and a\n\n           couple mouthfuls of piss.\n\n          Pause.\n\n           Did I say the weather is great?\n\n           Well, it is. Though flash floods\n\n           potential is still present. There's\n\n           4-prong major canyons upstream from\n\n           me that all converge in this 3 foot\n\n           wide gap where I am.

He swoons and stares\n\n          at it. He slowly grasps the tool more firmly and wriggles it\n\n          slightly, the blade connects with something hard. He taps the\n\n          knife down and feels it knocking on the radius of his upper\n\n          forearm bone.\n\n          He puts his ear close and we can hear the little thocking\n\n          sound.\n\n                          ARON\n\n           Whoa, that's the bone.\n\n          He pulls the knife out opening the wound more.

I cut\n\n           down through the skin and the fatty\n\n           tissue, and through some of the\n\n           muscle.

He tries to blow it away. He fails. Tired,\n\n          it's too thick and he's too dehydrated. He picks up his knife\n\n          and using this starts sweeping the grit off his thumb.

It's a serrated, but clean,\n\n          successful break.\n\n          Still he says nothing.\n\n          Now he humps his body up and over the chockstone, smearing\n\n          his feet, one with a shoe, one without, against the wall, he\n\n          pushes grabbing further and further round the dark side of\n\n          the chockstone, pulling with a silent, furious intensity.\n\n          Hard, then harder, and HARDER.\n\n                         BANG\n\n          A second gun shot smashes around the canyon.

Deeper and deeper, down and down into the swirling\n\n          scoops of the sandstone. Couple of difficult manoeuvres, lots\n\n          of slipping and bumping, despite his best effort occasionally\n\n          his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops, winces and\n\n          grunts thru the pain.\n\n          But on he goes, 100 ft of the rope trailing behind him.

DAY.\n\n          Finally, we burst into the dazzling midday sun on a rock\n\n          shelf halfway up a sheer walled amphitheatre, 200ft high. The\n\n          scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking, the\n\n          dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his\n\n          dry eyes.\n\n          He sees, for the first time in his new life, green. The deep\n\n          green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and\n\n          he knows. He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and\n\n          he knows. Now he can look down. Right to the edge of\n\n          vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow\n\n          turgid water. Life itself. He wanted it to be there and now\n\n          he's mesmerized by it. A pair of swifts leave the tree and\n\n          zig zag up and around him. He wobbles and has to stop himself\n\n          lunging head first over the precipice. Instead he drops to\n\n          the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign\n\n          land.\n\n          Unravelling the rope of its knots, he's baking in blazing\n\n           70.\n\n          light. He can't go yet, every knot must be undone pulled open\n\n          between his teeth and his hand. But he'll die if he can't\n\n          have moisture. He tips the saved urine over himself and\n\n          licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and\n\n          listens. He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip... The rope is\n\n          uncoiling over the ledge. He put it down to drink. Picking up\n\n          speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left. He\n\n          lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time. That was\n\n          his future disappearing over the ledge.\n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. CANYON.

It's a difficult overhang and he's\n\n          awkward and vulnerable with only one useful arm. His bad arm\n\n          catches horribly on the lip of the ledge.

There's so many of them they fill the\n\n          screen. Tucked deep into the sofa, is his son giggling away.\n\n          They smile, simple, silent support for him.
