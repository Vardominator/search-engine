He pulls\n\nthe ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet.  He reaches forward to\n\nflush.  Can't do it.  Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the\n\ntoilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring.\n\nHe puts it on and washes his hands.

We don't see what he sees, but we know\n\nwhat he sees.  Suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing\n\ntorrent thunders in.  Bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor.\n\nHe scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the\n\ncorridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably.  He's\n\nnot going to make it.  He reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through.\n\nGrabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with\n\nthe strength of this arms.  It doesn't work.  The steel door closes on the\n\nfingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe.\n\nBut something amazing happens.  His wedding ring lodges between the door and\n\nframe, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from\n\nsealing and locking.\n\nIt resists tons of pressure, denting but not collapsing.\n\nThe freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear.\n\n                                BUD\n\n                Heeyy!!

Sonny wedges\n\na crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry.  Catfish whips open his\n\njackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator.  He is\n\nsprayed with red hydraulic fluid, machine blood.\n\nTogether they force open the door.  Bud is blown through in a torture of\n\nwater.  Sonny is thrown back into some pipes.  Breaks his arm.\n\nTogether they somehow heave the door shut manually, cutting off the flow.\n\nCatfish hammers the fail-safe latch home with the crowbar.\n\nBud lies gasping and shivering... staring at the tiny band of metal that\n\nsaved him.\n\n                                                                DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

Then...\n\nA cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending\n\nshadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to\n\npulsate.\n\nSuddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering\n\npseudopod as big around as a man's body.

Like a blindly probing glass\n\npython, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends,\n\nstretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.

The\n\npseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.\n\nIN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet.  Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her\n\nchair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle\n\nenters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching.\n\nIt undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying\n\neverything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head,\n\nturning... sees the apparition next to her.\n\nHer eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still\n\nsearching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth.\n\nBud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging\n\nopen like a total goon.\n\nBud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.\n\nCatfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open\n\nnow.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to\n\nrecognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to\n\nher.  She holds her ground, fascinated.\n\nThe bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water,\n\nstill clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.

Lindsey makes a\n\nface, sticking out her tongue... testing it.\n\nThe liquid-Lindsey does the same.

Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface.\n\nRipples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features.\n\nHer fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's\n\ndipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways.

Through\n\nthe lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from\n\nits exit point under the stern.  Bud see a shortcut under the platform.\n\nHe kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over-\n\nhand stokes.  He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.\n\nMisses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing\n\nbehind it.  He is jerked along behind the sub.\n\nBud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful\n\nthrusters.  Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal\n\nwall.  The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls\n\nhimself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.\n\nLOW ANGLE, look up the wall.  Flatbed appears over the edge and stops.\n\nHovering.\n\nON THE BACK OF FLATBED.  Bud has the break he needs.  He scrambles up onto the\n\ndeck and opens and equipment locker.  Nothing in it but one of the yellow\n\nnylon safety lines.  The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.\n\nINT./EXT.

He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.\n\nGEEK/ROV had a passenger.  Brigman.  The diver is holding Geek's skid with\n\none hand, doing something with the other.  He turns to look at Coffey.\n\nEXT. FLATBED/DEEPCORE                                                   181\n\nCoffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the\n\nsteel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud\n\nkicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie\n\none end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending\n\nan acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its\n\nload of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.\n\nCoffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large\n\njumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is\n\nhauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV\n\nstrains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping\n\nas Bud fights to make a knot.\n\nFlatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of\n\nsediment from the escarpment face.\n\nThrough the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.\n\nThe big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An\n\nenormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.\n\nThe big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud.\n\nBud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming.\n\nGlare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as\n\nCoffey closes the last few feet.\n\nOne manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside\n\nrakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of\n\npipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!!\n\nINT.

DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED                                          183\n\nBud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in\n\nCoffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris.\n\nIt pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him.\n\nNearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO.\n\nDETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon\n\nline starts to play through the knot slowly.\n\nBUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the\n\ncliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a\n\ntruck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward.\n\nFlatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to\n\nside, up or down.\n\nCoffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in,\n\nblinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full\n\nthrottle.\n\nAt the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible\n\nslews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is\n\nsmashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey\n\nlooks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She\n\ncruises up over Bud.\n\n                                LINDSEY (V.O.)\n\n                Get in!\n\nBud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly.\n\nINT./EXT.

He ditches his helmet.\n\nLindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall.  Through the front port\n\nthere is not sign of Coffey.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n\n                You owe me one, Virgil.\n\n                                BUD\n\n                Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.\n\nHe points.  Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at\n\nits leash.  Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to\n\nopen her own small manipulator claws.\n\nEXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC.                                                185\n\nThe last few feet of the rope slip through the knot.\n\nBig Geek happily surges forward.  It dives gracefully down into the void,\n\ntrailing the yellow rope like a kite tail.\n\nONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port.\n\n                                BUD\n\n                Go after it!  We gotta catch it!\n\nFLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.  They are\n\nslammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full\n\nthrottle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his\n\nmore powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.\n\nShe arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She\n\nfights for control.\n\nINT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       186\n\nBud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls.  Lindsey flies with her\n\njaw set.  Fighting hard for control.  The A-frame of the rig looms before her.\n\nShe shoots through at full throttle.\n\nEXT.

The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical\n\nmodules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure\n\nhulls.\n\nCoffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along\n\nthe flank of one of the trimodules.\n\nThey head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.\n\nLindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing\n\nup the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock\n\npinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.\n\nCoffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.\n\nLindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that.\n\nAhead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.\n\nLindsey rises, cuts right.\n\nSmashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in\n\nthe rocks.\n\nFlatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom.\n\nPressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.\n\nIt smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.\n\nTangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the\n\nwall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds\n\nher crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.\n\nANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's\n\ntail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.\n\nINT.

As the\n\npressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with\n\nthe enormous load.\n\nA tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows.\n\nCoffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned\n\nsoul dropping into the bottomless pit.\n\nThe fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port.\n\nSuddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes\n\ninto him.  A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a\n\nbloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards.\n\nEXT.

Her hands grip his shoulders like claws.  She bucks and thrashes.\n\nBud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.\n\n                                BUD\n\n                NOOOOO!!!\n\nThe freezing seawater races into her lungs.  Her finger go slack, and her\n\nhands float lifelessly.\n\nBud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open\n\nmouth.

Bud bursts to the surface.  Together they haul Lindsey\n\nacross the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck.  Her skin is blue-\n\nwhite, her chest still.\n\nBud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a\n\nmission.  The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see\n\nLindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert.  Water flows from her mouth and\n\nnose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp.

Hippy pushes him\n\nback and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth.  He opens the valve\n\non the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag.

A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One\n\nNight, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down.  It is like the circular top of\n\na dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water.  It is\n\nas if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing\n\nsmaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes\n\na point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a\n\nturned-off TV.\n\nTIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring.

You can do it... fight your\n\n                way back, baby...\n\nThe others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.\n\nShe starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air\n\ninto her lungs.  Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re-\n\nestablish circulation.  It is like a difficult birth.  Lindsey comes hacking\n\nand howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.\n\nBud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized\n\nbreath.  He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands,\n\nand watches her breathe.  Color is returning to her skin as she lies there,\n\ngasping weakly.\n\nONE THE GROUP...

We see what's\n\ndriving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being\n\nable to prevent this situation.\n\nHe touches her cheek, one last time.  She sees his fingers are trembling.\n\nThen he puts on the gloves.  Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's\n\nforearm.

Just let\n\n                yourself take it in.\n\nSuddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid.  His eyes go wide,\n\ninstant panic.  He starts to thrash.

He finds her eyes, the look\n\ncalming him.  He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned.\n\nHis spasms subside.  He begins to \"breathe\" normally.  He gets a goofy look\n\nof wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing.  He is\n\nalive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet.  He grins.\n\nGives a big thumbs up.

His chest barely moving.\n\nA strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly,\n\nhe raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.\n\nBUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to\n\nbe an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an\n\nextraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body\n\nand limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A\n\ndelicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates\n\ngently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The\n\nhead is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a\n\ncold, dispassionate wisdom.\n\nIt is stunningly beautiful.\n\nThe creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.\n\nIts slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from\n\nthe benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the\n\nabyss.\n\nAt the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They\n\nresolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey\n\nnearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And\n\nothers, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.\n\nSuddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of\n\nbrightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below\n\nthem, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the\n\ncenter, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing\n\ntheir home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a\n\nmajor city.\n\nEXT. N.T.I.

The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility.\n\nTowers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It\n\ndwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon\n\nyawns like a vast mouth.\n\nThey are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth-\n\nlike opening.\n\nINT.

It is a\n\ncurving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system,\n\nwhere controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional\n\nspace.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet\n\nacross, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.\n\nINT.

The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls.\n\nThey move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.\n\nWeakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees.\n\nDoubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs.\n\nHe lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what\n\nhe can only hope is air.  It is.\n\nBud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is\n\nhappening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the\n\nNTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven\n\nis gathered watching him.\n\n                                BUD\n\n                Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?\n\nHis voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.  Soft laps of water\n\nfrom the 'walls'.\n\nIn the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be\n\ncircuit diagrams.  Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in\n\nmid-air.

BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN                                         243\n\nA depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not\n\nswirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.\n\nIt gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.\n\nThe ocean is OPENING.\n\nNow the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous\n\npower boil up from the depths.\n\nMcBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.\n\nThe open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.\n\nThe ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.\n\nSOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly\n\ncurving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another\n\nspire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the\n\nenergy of Niagara.\n\nOff the port bow... another spire.\n\nAnd another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.\n\nSix towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising.\n\nOne the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out\n\nthe sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF\n\nCREATION.\n\nAnd now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A\n\nPERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM\n\nTHE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE.\n\nTHE NTI ARK.\n\nIt surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad\n\nback.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic\n\nbeing, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat\n\nhull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.\n\nThe bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of\n\nthe vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth\n\nnearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.\n\nON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy\n\ncontingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.\n\nTouched by the hand of God.\n\n                                BENDIX\n\n                Look...\n\nWHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore\n\nTwo.  It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the\n\nglistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.\n\nCLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.\n\nCatfish's feet appear, bicycling.  He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.\n\nStands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.  Jammer plonks down behind\n\nhim.  He turns, lifts Lindsey down.  Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into\n\nthe light of the sun.  A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever\n\nknow.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n\n                We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.\n\n                                CATFISH\n\n                Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-\n\n                up Coke.\n\n                                HIPPY\n\n                They must've done something to us.\n\nLindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for\n\ntheir deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for\n\nthe whole human race.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n\n                Oh, yes.  I think you could say that.\n\nShe blinks.  Seeing something not far away.  She gives a little laugh, or\n\nsomething between laughing and crying.\n\nREVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like\n\nenterances to the NTI structure.  His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS\n\nhelmet dangles from one hand jauntily.\n\nShe starts toward him.  Breaks into a run.  Then stops a few feet from him.\n\nWatching him come to her.\n\nHis smile, his eyes illuminating her.\n\nHe stops and she touches him, lightly.  Is this real?\n\nThe look at each other, wonderingly a moment.\n\nThen laugh.  She sniffs loudly.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n\n                Hello, Brigman.\n\n                                BUD\n\n                Hello, Mrs. Brigman.\n\nTheir lips meet.\n\n                                                                CUT TO BLACK"}
