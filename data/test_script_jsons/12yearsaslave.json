TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1\n\n           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-\n\n           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A\n\n           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.\n\n           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high\n\n           end piece, but it is quite nice.\n\n           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair\n\n           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late\n\n           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,\n\n           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.\n\n           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.\n\n           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing\n\n           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to\n\n           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:\n\n           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING\n\n           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being\n\n           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In\n\n           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are\n\n           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women\n\n           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense\n\n           that for the most part they are people of means.\n\n           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At\n\n           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a\n\n           REEL.\n\n           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,\n\n           having cut directly from the tune he was previously\n\n           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no\n\n           way seems possessed with empty servitude.\n\n           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into\n\n           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal\n\n           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear\n\n           that despite their respective races there is much\n\n           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.\n\n           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n           It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is\n\n           ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We\n\n           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and\n\n           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed\n\n           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          2.\n\n                         3 CONTINUED: 3\n\n           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if\n\n           preparing to pose for a portrait.\n\n           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.\n\n           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY\n\n           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,\n\n           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his\n\n           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and\n\n           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and\n\n           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss\n\n           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.\n\n           EXT. STREET - DAY\n\n           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets\n\n           and groves of Saratoga.\n\n           The streets are well populated this morning with many\n\n           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are\n\n           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly\n\n           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.\n\n           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their\n\n           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south\n\n           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are\n\n           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are\n\n           well dressed and \"leading apparently an easy life\" -\n\n           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.\n\n           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an\n\n           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart\n\n           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the\n\n           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for\n\n           Solomon to help her across.\n\n                          ANNE\n\n           Solomon...\n\n           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile\n\n           waving her forward:\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Come, Anne. Jump.\n\n           The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.\n\n                          ALONZO MARGARET\n\n           Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make\n\n           it.\n\n                          ANNE\n\n           I will not ruin my dress. Catch\n\n           me!\n\n           Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's\n\n           still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne\n\n           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon\n\n           replies.\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          3.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           I will catch you, Anne.\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           I will.\n\n           Again, lightly stern:\n\n                          ANNE\n\n           You will.\n\n           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,\n\n           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to\n\n           the delighted applause of the children. That done,\n\n           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.\n\n           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the\n\n           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.\n\n           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon\n\n           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of\n\n           this most handsome and harmonious group should be\n\n           obvious.\n\n           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the\n\n           STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.\n\n           Suddenly a voice barks out-\n\n           A VOICE (O.S.)\n\n           Jasper! Come on!\n\n           INT. STORE - LATER\n\n           We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man\n\n           and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him\n\n                          WITH:\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Mr. Parker.\n\n                          PARKER\n\n           Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.\n\n           With money in hand the Northup children move quickly\n\n           about the store looking for items to purchase.\n\n                          CONTINUED:\n\n           Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests\n\n                          TO SOLOMON:\n\n                          PARKER (CONT'D)\n\n           A new cravat, Solomon? Pure silk\n\n           by way of the French.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           We are in need of a fresh carry\n\n           all for the Mrs's travels.\n\n                          PARKER\n\n           A year's passed?

Children, come\n\n           see what your father has just\n\n           purchased for me.\n\n           As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the\n\n           new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered\n\n           the store.\n\n           At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY\n\n           HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the\n\n           book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:\n\n                          PARKER\n\n           If you would sign our condolence\n\n           book. My hope is to find a way to\n\n           forward it to the Widow Harrison.\n\n           Sad days for the nation.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris\n\n           and her children. I hope brighter\n\n           times ahead.\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          4A.\n\n                         5 CONTINUED: (2) 5\n\n           Jasper looks scared, timid. It's as though he'd like to\n\n           engage, but is unsure of as to how. Noting Jasper, Parker\n\n                          SAYS:\n\n                          PARKER\n\n           A moment, sir, and you will be\n\n           assisted.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           If we could discuss the price...\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          5.\n\n                         5 CONTINUED: (3) 5\n\n                          PARKER\n\n           Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

It is a cold glare as\n\n           though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a\n\n           response from a black man. Looking back to Parker:\n\n                          FITZGERALD\n\n           Good day, sir.\n\n                         6 6\n\n           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/DINING ROOM - EVENING\n\n           Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the\n\n           meal, which is just about to begin. Solomon, in the\n\n           meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a\n\n           NEWSPAPER. He reads to his children solemn news of the\n\n           funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President\n\n           Harrison.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           \"Thus has passed away from earth\n\n           our late President.\"\n\n           Solomon starts from the top of the article.\n\n                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)\n\n           \"During the morning, from sunrise,\n\n           the heavy bells had been pealing\n\n           forth their slow and solemn toll\n\n           while the minute guns announced\n\n           that soon the grave would receive\n\n           its trust.

The Driver\n\n           loads bags into the carriage.\n\n           For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Travel safely.\n\n                          ANNE\n\n           Stay safely.\n\n           Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the\n\n           horse and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty\n\n           good bye to his wife and children.\n\n                         10 10\n\n           EXT. PARK - DAY\n\n           Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men - two\n\n           in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR.\n\n           MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown\n\n           is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and\n\n           intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair\n\n           complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a\n\n           bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes\n\n           him, slightly effeminate.\n\n           Moon, spotting Solomon:\n\n           MR.

Though Solomon\n\n           remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of\n\n           being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little\n\n           money was collected.\n\n                          HAMILTON\n\n           Not an additional tip from a one\n\n           of them.

GADSBY HOTEL - STAIRCASE A23\n\n           Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral\n\n           staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest.\n\n          23 INT. GADSBY HOTEL/SOLOMON'S ROOM - NIGHT 23\n\n           Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where\n\n           a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the\n\n           bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton\n\n           speaks sweetly.\n\n                          HAMILTON\n\n           I'm afraid that Brown and I\n\n           haven't brought you much luck.\n\n           But rough waters bring smooth\n\n           sailing.

And\n\n           tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel\n\n           as well and refreshed as though\n\n           the earth were new again.\n\n           Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to\n\n           Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of\n\n                          SIGNIFICATION:\n\n                          BROWN\n\n           Hamilton!

He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A\n\n           CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than\n\n           night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the\n\n           dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE\n\n           DISTRESSED.\n\n                         24 24\n\n           INT.

He finds himself in a nearly lightless\n\n           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid\n\n           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small\n\n           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only\n\n           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box\n\n           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are\n\n           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and\n\n           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But\n\n           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.\n\n           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He\n\n           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails\n\n           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and\n\n           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams\n\n           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his\n\n           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.\n\n           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,\n\n           slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed\n\n           state he remains.\n\n                         25 25\n\n           INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING\n\n           Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the\n\n           door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter\n\n           JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER\n\n           RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.\n\n           As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into\n\n           the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to\n\n           Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch\n\n                          ASKS:\n\n                          BURCH\n\n           Well, my boy, how yah feel now?\n\n           Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he\n\n           can put together he states what he considers to be fact:\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           I am Solomon Northup. I am a free\n\n           man; a resident of Saratoga, New\n\n           York. The residence also of my\n\n           wife and children who are equally\n\n           free. I have papers. You have no\n\n           right whatsoever to detain me--\n\n                          BURCH\n\n           Yah not any--\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           And I promise you - I promise -\n\n           upon my liberation I will have\n\n           satisfaction for this wrong.\n\n                          BURCH\n\n           Resolve this. Produce your\n\n           papers.\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          17.\n\n                         25 CONTINUED: 25\n\n           With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his\n\n           trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are\n\n           empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his\n\n           papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,\n\n           but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will\n\n           not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:\n\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n\n           Yah no free man. And yah ain't\n\n           from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.\n\n           A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon\n\n           and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man\n\n           yielding. Burch says again:\n\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n\n           Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'\n\n           but a Georgia runaway.\n\n           Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not\n\n           in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.\n\n           The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,\n\n           leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT\n\n           DISTINGUISH.\n\n           Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of\n\n           \"instruments:\" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is\n\n           about the size in circumference of two open hands, and\n\n           bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also\n\n           carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many\n\n           strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the\n\n           extremity of each. Burch says again:\n\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n\n           Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.\n\n           Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say\n\n           nothing of the kind.\n\n           As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is\n\n           pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his\n\n           back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon\n\n           down in a bent position.\n\n           With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the\n\n           back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no\n\n           taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each\n\n           blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND\n\n           BRUISES.\n\n           This beating continues on and on and on until quite\n\n           literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.\n\n           Dripping in sweat and panting:\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          18.\n\n                         25 CONTINUED: (2) 25\n\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n\n           Yah still insist yah a free man?\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           ...I...I insist...\n\n           Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but\n\n           rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to\n\n           beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch\n\n           returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows\n\n                          WITH:\n\n                          BURCH\n\n           Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!\n\n           Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until\n\n           the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.\n\n           Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,\n\n           the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's\n\n           arm tires before Solomon \"breaks.\"\n\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n\n           Are yah slave?\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           ...No...\n\n           Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...\n\n           SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND\n\n           OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He\n\n           pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough\n\n           energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn\n\n           lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's\n\n           legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these\n\n           gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one\n\n           wrought with poor sincerity::\n\n                          RADBURN\n\n           I seen a good many of the black\n\n           kind just where yah're. Sick.\n\n           Make me sick. Often times the\n\n           situation was resolved, and I\n\n           think; what was all the beatin'\n\n           and abuse for? Things end as they\n\n           should, and the violence was for\n\n           naught. So why cause trouble when\n\n           they ain't no cause for it? Be of\n\n           a cooperative nature, and things\n\n           don't need be particularly\n\n           unpleasant.\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           Or, yah can carry on like yah\n\n           been, and I fear yah won't live to\n\n           see Sunday next.\n\n           With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to\n\n           rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          19.\n\n                         25 CONTINUED: (3) 25\n\n           on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain\n\n           loosens none. Solomon calls out:\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Help me! Someone help me!\n\n           If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon\n\n           continues his plaintive cry for assistance.\n\n                         26 26\n\n           EXT.

In the yard are two men, and a boy.\n\n           The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.\n\n           He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years\n\n           old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in\n\n           education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.\n\n           Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who\n\n           answers to the name of Randall.\n\n           Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.\n\n           Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are\n\n           all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is\n\n           present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD\n\n           WATER. He throws water on the naked men.\n\n                          RADBURN\n\n           Go on.

BURCH'S DUNGEON - EVENING A32\n\n           Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of\n\n           meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain\n\n           Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT.\n\n                          RADBURN\n\n           That old thing of yours is just\n\n           rags and tatters.

Put it on.\n\n           With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed.

She is \"arrayed in silk, with rings upon her\n\n           fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears.\"\n\n           Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this\n\n           point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and\n\n           her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin\n\n           color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's\n\n           half sister.\n\n           As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,\n\n           then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy.

The\n\n           added promise in time I would be\n\n           emancipated.

Chief among them is ROBERT \n\n           who fights viciously with his captors. \"With all haste\" \n\n           is shoved down into the hold. \n\n           Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, \n\n           Burch and Radburn depart.

If it \n\n           were well planned, I believe \n\n           they could be strong armed. \n\n                          CLEMENS RAY \n\n           Three can't stand against a whole \n\n           crew.

He bends \n\n           down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her \n\n           face. \n\n           Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. \n\n           From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt \n\n           the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back \n\n           at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the \n\n           hold. \n\n           As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand \n\n           between Eliza and the Sailor.

Slowly, a greasy smile \n\n           erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of \n\n           incomprehension. \n\n           Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that \n\n           has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. \n\n           The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. \n\n           A wide shot of the two men.

These are humans held in strict bondage -\n\n           herded like cattle, chained together as if in a \"chain\n\n           gang.\" Slaves are evident not merely by the color of\n\n           their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are\n\n           everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars -\n\n           THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT\n\n           UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks\n\n           are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to\n\n           elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.\n\n           Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is\n\n           attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and\n\n           tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A\n\n           CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER\n\n           PRESENT, BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE\n\n           NORM.

Sometimes his patience gets the better\n\n           of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the\n\n           slaves.\n\n           The business has the air of an etiquette class, though\n\n           what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into\n\n           being more \"sellable.\" He works with them in groups of\n\n           five or so.\n\n                          FREEMAN\n\n           Tallest to smallest, understand?\n\n           Are you taller than her?

As he does, he stares out toward the flowing\n\n           waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a\n\n           thought far greater than relieving himself has come to\n\n           him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.\n\n           Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were\n\n           a man possessed.\n\n                         75 75\n\n           EXT.

The slaves are again gathered in the rose\n\n           garden near the front of the house to hear the word of\n\n           the Lord as read by Master Ford.\n\n                          FORD\n\n           And Jesus called a little child\n\n           unto him, and set him in the midst\n\n           of them, And said, Verily I say\n\n           unto you, Except ye be converted,\n\n           and become as little children, ye\n\n           shall not enter into the kingdom\n\n           of heaven.\n\n           The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears. She begins to\n\n           sob uncontrollably.\n\n           Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper-\n\n           MRS.

Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen\n\n           working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon,\n\n           Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection.

FORD PLANATION - DAY\n\n           -END OF JANUARY, 1842- [OVER ONE DAY]\n\n           We see Solomon working as a carpenter, helping to erect a\n\n           Weaving House that stands off to the side of the\n\n           plantation's Great House.\n\n           At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding. Tibeats\n\n           arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           Make them boards flush.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           They are, sir.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           They is no such thing.\n\n           Solomon runs his hands over the boards.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           As smooth to the touch as a\n\n           yearling's coat.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           Callin' me a liar, boy?\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Only a matter of perspective, sir.\n\n           From where you stand you may see\n\n           differently. But the hands are\n\n           not mistaken. I ask only that you\n\n           employ all your senses before\n\n           rendering judgement.\n\n           What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact? All he can do\n\n           is spew invectives.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           You are a brute.

Solomon goes back to his work.\n\n           After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in\n\n           the drive of the great house. It involves an\n\n           inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart\n\n           DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN. Mistress Ford and Rachel watch.\n\n           Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days\n\n           as a free man is driven away to a location unknown.\n\n                         83 83\n\n           EXT. WEAVING HOUSE - MORNING\n\n           It is day break.

WEAVING HOUSE - LATER\n\n           As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking\n\n           in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Even\n\n           before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of\n\n           belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           I thought I told yah ta commence\n\n           ta puttin' on clapboards this\n\n           morn'.\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          54.\n\n                         84 CONTINUED: 84\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Yes, master. I am about it. I\n\n           have begun on the other side of\n\n           the house.\n\n           Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is\n\n           picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           Didn't I tell yah last night to\n\n           get a keg of nails of Chapin?\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           And so I did; and Chapin said he\n\n           would get another size for you, if\n\n           you wanted them when he came back\n\n           from the field.\n\n           Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward\n\n           Solomon \"with a great passion:\"\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed\n\n           somethin'!\n\n           Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in\n\n           no mood for Tibeats.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           I did as instructed. If there's\n\n           something wrong, then its wrong\n\n           with your instructions.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           Yah black bastard! Yah goddman\n\n           black bastard!\n\n           In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza\n\n           to fetch a whip.\n\n           Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and\n\n           Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,\n\n           runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's\n\n           instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats\n\n           marches back whip in hand.\n\n                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)\n\n           Strip yer clothes!\n\n           Solomon does no such thing.\n\n                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)\n\n           Strip!\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           I will not.\n\n           With \"concentrated vengeance,\" Tibeats springs for\n\n           Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          55.\n\n                         84 CONTINUED: (2) 84\n\n           raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike\n\n           the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar\n\n           of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,\n\n           Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back\n\n           with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A\n\n           violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to\n\n           Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches\n\n           the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the\n\n           handle again and again and again.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           Yew will not live ta see another\n\n           day, nigger! This is yer last, I\n\n           swear it!\n\n           Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.\n\n           Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's\n\n           wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around\n\n           Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.\n\n           Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and\n\n           then pleas for mercy:\n\n                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)\n\n           Murder! It's murder! Lord, God,\n\n           help me. God be merciful!\n\n           And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks-\n\n                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)\n\n           Papa I'm sorry!\n\n           Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.\n\n           Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers\n\n           a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the\n\n           ground.\n\n                          CHAPIN\n\n           What is the matter?\n\n           Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of\n\n           dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on\n\n                          SOLOMON:\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Master Tibeats wants to whip me\n\n           for using the nails you gave me.\n\n                          CHAPIN\n\n           What's the matter with the nails?\n\n           With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats\n\n           says, as if being exposed-\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           They're...they're too large.\n\n                          CHAPIN\n\n           I am overseer here.

I will\n\n           have flesh, and I will have all of\n\n           it.\n\n           Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.\n\n           Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He\n\n           looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.\n\n           Anxiety mounts on his features.\n\n           A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles\n\n           his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to\n\n           fetch him.\n\n           Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is\n\n           visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.\n\n           Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off\n\n           an air of impending trouble.\n\n                          CHAPIN\n\n           Do not stir. Do not attempt to\n\n           leave the plantation on any\n\n           account whatever.

Rachel...!\n\n           Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a\n\n           distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log\n\n           kitchen.\n\n           Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is\n\n           to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we\n\n           continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the\n\n           unexpected mounts.\n\n           Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,\n\n           and he knows that death awaits him.\n\n           A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS\n\n           THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it.\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          57.\n\n                         84 CONTINUED: (4) 84\n\n           Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and\n\n           watches, but does not move to Solomon.\n\n           Solomon waits, and waits...\n\n           WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and\n\n           louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats.\n\n           He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They\n\n           carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           Tha's the one. Tha's him.\n\n           Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with\n\n           perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon\n\n           tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by\n\n           TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same\n\n           manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a\n\n           cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back\n\n           and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a\n\n           peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of\n\n           it intensely palpable.\n\n           Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.\n\n           Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the\n\n           verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,\n\n           he begins to struggle and fight.\n\n           A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over\n\n           the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.\n\n           He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the\n\n           life is choked from him.\n\n           With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing\n\n           a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber\n\n           \"Holster\" pistols with 9\" barrels. Chapin moves with\n\n           determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and\n\n           matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't\n\n           need to be much more demonstrative.\n\n                          CHAPIN\n\n           Gentlemen... Whoever moves that\n\n           nigger another foot from where he\n\n           stands is a dead man. I am\n\n           overseer of this plantation seven\n\n           years, and in the absence of\n\n           William Ford, my duty is to\n\n           protect his interests. Ford holds\n\n           a mortgage on Platt of four\n\n           hundred dollars. If you hang him,\n\n           he loses his debt. Until that is\n\n           canceled you have no claim to his\n\n           life.\n\n           Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook:\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          58.\n\n                         84 CONTINUED: (5) 84\n\n                          CHAPIN (CONT'D)\n\n           As for you two, if you have any\n\n           regard for your own safety...I\n\n           say, begone!\n\n           Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols\n\n           Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without\n\n           further word, they mount their horses and ride away.\n\n           Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.\n\n                          TIBEATS\n\n           Yah got no cause.

There is a surreal moment\n\n           as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He\n\n           chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the\n\n           neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the\n\n                          DISTANCE:\n\n                          CHAPIN\n\n           Sam!

FORD PLANATION - LATER\n\n           HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight\n\n           and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as\n\n           Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was\n\n           left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on\n\n           the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the\n\n           field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.\n\n           It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging\n\n           even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this\n\n           time and space.\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          59.\n\n                         85 CONTINUED: 85\n\n           Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his\n\n           hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and\n\n           better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate\n\n           Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as\n\n           though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a\n\n           property dispute, he offers no further aid.\n\n           Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the\n\n           sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches\n\n           of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in\n\n           Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he\n\n           cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes\n\n           flutter between life and lifelessness...\n\n                         86 86\n\n                          OMIT\n\n          87 EXT.

He may not die from hanging, but he may\n\n           very well expire before the day is over.\n\n           Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she\n\n           were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of\n\n           water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for\n\n           him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the\n\n           water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats,\n\n           and leaves Solomon to hang.\n\n                         88 88\n\n           EXT. FORD PLANATION - EVENING\n\n           The sun is just now arching for the horizon. Solomon\n\n           remains, as though his torture will not end. Ford,\n\n           trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts,\n\n           and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache:\n\n                          FORD\n\n           Platt... My poor Platt.\n\n           Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose.

FORD PLANATION/GREAT HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n           As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on\n\n           the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He\n\n           is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his\n\n           bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS\n\n           HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to\n\n           the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has\n\n           largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It\n\n           will be the \"first and last time such a sumptuous resting\n\n           place was granted\" during his twelve years of bondage.\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          60.\n\n                         89 CONTINUED: 89\n\n           Solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his\n\n           surroundings.

He\n\n           goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see\n\n           nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon.\n\n           He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation.\n\n                          FORD\n\n           I believe Tibeats is skulkin'\n\n           about the premises somewhere.

She\n\n           is the offspring of a \"Guinea nigger,\" brought over to\n\n           Cuba in a slave ship.

A few moments of\n\n           Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.\n\n           Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all\n\n           her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square\n\n           in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY\n\n           AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.\n\n           The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first\n\n           time they've seen as much from the Mistress.\n\n           Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion:\n\n                          MISTRESS EPPS\n\n           Sell her!\n\n                          EPPS\n\n           C'mon, now.

His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees \n\n           flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. \n\n           The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, \n\n           heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. \n\n           The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is \n\n           silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, \n\n           preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's \n\n           eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with \n\n           a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose \n\n           around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start \n\n           barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of \n\n           Solomon.

The two men are hoisted up, kicking and \n\n           spitting, behind his shoulder. \n\n           Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards \n\n           Bartholomew's, his face now full of shock and \n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n           68A.\n\n          A101 CONTINUED: A101\n\n           trepidation.

Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around\n\n           the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,\n\n           however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as\n\n           speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.\n\n           And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and\n\n           suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely\n\n           breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts\n\n           up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.\n\n           Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in\n\n           what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after\n\n           Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can\n\n           even get close to the slave.\n\n           Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n          73.\n\n                         105 CONTINUED: (2) 105\n\n                          EPPS (CONT'D)\n\n           Platt...

Cautiously, Solomon\n\n           moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within\n\n           striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases\n\n           Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more\n\n           drops down.

I concede to yah,\n\n           but in the name of valor, help yer\n\n           master to his feet.\n\n           Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is\n\n           attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is\n\n           too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and\n\n           chased far around the field by Epps.

He stops, stands as if gathering his\n\n           manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and\n\n           clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape\n\n           and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.\n\n           Patsey does not respond in any way other than to\n\n           continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain\n\n           as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is\n\n           vicious with her passive aggressiveness.\n\n           Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw\n\n           had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to\n\n           violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response\n\n           from her. When that fails, he punches her which only\n\n           leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey\n\n           MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,\n\n           Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep\n\n           breathing above her.

Her non responsiveness,\n\n           however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming:\n\n           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)\n\n           Yah see that?

Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes\n\n           no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.\n\n           Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely\n\n           stand to face. Fear, proximity...

Solomon\n\n           tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.\n\n           Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her\n\n           breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -\n\n           really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE\n\n           ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,\n\n           FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN\n\n           AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE\n\n           SOLOMON.\n\n           The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to\n\n           Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER\n\n           DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more\n\n           compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO\n\n           MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more\n\n           perfunctory than passionate.\n\n           We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual\n\n           release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous\n\n           sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against\n\n           reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that\n\n           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.\n\n           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna\n\n           turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is\n\n           as though the act had not happened at all.\n\n                         122 122\n\n                          OMIT\n\n          123 EXT.

It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable.\n\n           Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed\n\n           berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper.\n\n           The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.\n\n           Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle.

SLAVE SHACK - DAY A127A \n\n           We see a sharp object scratching onto a surface. The \n\n           tool moves on to form another mark. The sound is \n\n           repetitive and almost unbearable. As we move out, we see \n\n           the names Anne, Margaret, Alonzo. They are engraved onto \n\n           the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest \n\n           his chin. \n\n           Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips \n\n           across the engraving. His face full of loss. \n\n           Sadly, he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning \n\n           his head to the side as if to play. \n\n          127 INT. YARNEY'S HOUSE - EVENING 127\n\n           A party has commenced at the noble home of one MR.\n\n           YARNEY. A group of REVELERS have gathered and are on the\n\n           dance floor, in fancy dress. Their faces are covered with\n\n           a variation of decorative masks. The party is a feast of\n\n           celebration. As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A\n\n           GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three. And as he does\n\n           so, they all play with jovial liveliness. Clearly a good\n\n           time is being had by all.\n\n                         128 128\n\n           EXT.

As he walks, Solomon eats from a\n\n           HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD. Obviously part of his haul from\n\n           the evening. Solomon again hears noises coming from the\n\n           brush just up ahead of him. Solomon tears off some of\n\n           the bread, kneels and holds it out before him.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           C'mere.

Instead, from the dark and\n\n           the brush step TWO BLACK MEN. Solomon stands. He looks\n\n           the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves\n\n           covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not\n\n           just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly\n\n           toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.\n\n           At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money.\n\n           Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE.\n\n           Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is\n\n           attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM. Solomon fights back,\n\n           PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the\n\n           head. That takes the fight out of him, and both men\n\n           retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be.\n\n                         A129 A129\n\n           EXT.

From the\n\n           edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen\n\n           from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of\n\n           about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.\n\n           \"IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER\n\n           FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD.\" Beyond\n\n           that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.\n\n           Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.\n\n           Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.\n\n           It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in\n\n           her dress.\n\n           Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As\n\n           Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite\n\n                          PLAINLY:\n\n                          CELESTE\n\n           I am hungry.

As the strings are taut, the sound\n\n           is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as\n\n           if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the\n\n           breaking point of sound, there is a snap.\n\n           He then repeats the action.\n\n           Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb\n\n           and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it\n\n           at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it\n\n           from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the\n\n           ground.\n\n           He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it\n\n           falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small\n\n           bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of\n\n           violence, rather than aggressive.

Solomon,\n\n           aged significantly since then, stands nervously,\n\n           swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and\n\n           holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A\n\n           tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he\n\n           wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and\n\n           looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places\n\n           his hand on Solomon's shoulder.

Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family\n\n           waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.\n\n           Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the\n\n           body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They\n\n           are, after all - after twelve years - little more than\n\n           familiar strangers.\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           I apologize for my appearance.
