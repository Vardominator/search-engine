The eruptions shoot thousands of miles\n\n          into the blackness of space.\n\n                                                          FADE TO BLACK\n\n                                       2009\n\n                                                                FADE UP\n\n          EXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET\n\n          Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the\n\n          drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66,\n\n          listens to the music.\n\n          An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy\n\n          ship across a puddle.\n\n          The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.\n\n                                       PROF. WEST\n\n                       Watch out!\n\n          But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the\n\n          puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.\n\n          In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The\n\n          driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.\n\n          The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics -\n\n          University of New Delhi'.\n\n                                                                        2.\n\n          INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET\n\n          An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a\n\n          grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is\n\n          accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32.\n\n                                       PROF.

Used to be an old copper\n\n                    mine, Professor, sir.\n\n          As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting\n\n          for this science lab.\n\n                                     PROF.

But that is not what\n\n                    worries me...\n\n          They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small\n\n          group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all\n\n          show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.\n\n                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)\n\n                    There was a new solar storm, so strong\n\n                    that the physical reaction got even\n\n                    more severe.\n\n                                       PROF.

There he opens a hatch\n\n          on the floor and hot steam rises.\n\n                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)\n\n                    The neutrinos suddenly act like...\n\n                    microwaves.\n\n          Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the\n\n          water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale.\n\n                                                                CUT TO:\n\n                                                                        3.\n\n          EXT.

Dad?\n\n          Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and\n\n          hugs him.

A murmur goes through the crowd.\n\n          Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to\n\n          roll back and light streams in.\n\n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                     129.\n\n          The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser\n\n          looks hopeful.

AMERICAN SHIP/SOMEWHERE IN THE HIMALAYAS - DAY\n\n          Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the\n\n          clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of\n\n          day. A majestic moment.\n\n          EXT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY\n\n          They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice-\n\n          covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy.\n\n          Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's\n\n          HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site--\n\n          The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak,\n\n          surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most\n\n          beautiful rainbow. This is the new world.\n\n          And again we hear Mozart's Adagio...\n\n                                       THE END"}
