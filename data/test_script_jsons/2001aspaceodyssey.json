The reign of the ter-\n\nrible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent\n\nwhich would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival\n\nhad reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not\n\nyet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or\n\nthe swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a1\n\nA2\n\nINT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER\n\nThe man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and\n\nthey were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.\n\nAbout twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking\n\na small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.\n\nThe tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.\n\nAs the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher\n\ndiscovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know\n\nthe Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond\n\nhis understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-\n\niated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then\n\nhe carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the\n\nhyenas.\n\nAmong his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly\n\nfive feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over\n\na hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,\n\nand his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is\n\nlow, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he\n\nunmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As\n\nhe looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a2\n\nA2\n\nCONTINUED\n\nsomething in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those\n\ndark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-\n\ntions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another\n\ntwo million years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a3\n\nA3\n\nEXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS\n\nAs the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach\n\nthe shallow stream.\n\nThe Others are already there. They were there on the other\n\nside every day - that did not make it any less annoying.\n\nThere are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish\n\nthem from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As\n\nthey see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and\n\nshriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply\n\nIn kind.\n\nThe confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies\n\nout as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of\n\nthe muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has\n\nstaked its claim to its own territory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a4\n\nA4\n\nEXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES\n\nMoonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit\n\nand leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around\n\nthem, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential\n\nsource of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet\n\nall the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched\n\nsavanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;\n\nthe idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are\n\nslowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a5\n\nA5\n\nEXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION\n\nThe tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-\n\nside foraging for roots and occasional berries.\n\nEight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,\n\nabout fifty feet apart.\n\nThe ground is flat for miles around.\n\nSuddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking\n\nthem about 300 yards away.\n\nDefenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all\n\ndirections, but the lion brings one to the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a6\n\nA6\n\nEXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY\n\nIt had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no\n\nreal remembrance of the past he could not compare one day\n\nwith another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a\n\nhive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the\n\nfinest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he\n\nalso collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices\n\nthem. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever\n\nlikely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually\n\nweak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could\n\nhope for.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a7\n\nA7\n\nINT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS\n\nOver the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down\n\nfrom the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -\n\nbut cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;\n\nit was merely part of the background of life.\n\nThis Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,\n\nwas dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher\n\ncrawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides\n\nthe entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.\n\nIf any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back\n\nto the relative safety of the cave.\n\nOf all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's\n\nrace was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,\n\nand though he could not remember it, when he was young,\n\nMoonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.\n\nNow he new he would have to find a tree that was high\n\nenough.\n\nHe stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from\n\none of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a8\n\nA7\n\nCONTINUED\n\noccasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down\n\nthere in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,\n\nand the thought that he might help in some way never crosses\n\nMoonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out\n\nsuch fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.\n\nAnd in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and\n\nfearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations\n\nyet to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a9\n\nA8\n\nEXT  THE STREAM - INVASION\n\nThe Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of\n\nthe valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that\n\nMoonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the\n\nnight, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When\n\nthey meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a\n\ndeeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy\n\nbut usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds\n\nbefore the invasion begins.\n\nIn an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,\n\nshieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led\n\nby a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.\n\nStartled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first\n\nadvance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations\n\nat the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a\n\nmist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own\n\nterritory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.\n\nHe does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his\n\nexperience.\n\nThen he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a10\n\nA8\n\nCONTINUED\n\ndown, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they\n\nmove from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy\n\nthey become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original\n\ndrive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.\n\nAs he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately\n\nrevives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make\n\nreassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill\n\nhis dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and\n\nleadership.\n\nBefore he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and\n\nthe two tribes come to a halt many paces away.\n\nThe disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended\n\nquickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this\n\ninnovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the\n\nfuture. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and\n\nscratch and try to bite each other.\n\nRolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,\n\nand when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a11\n\nA8\n\nCONTINUED\n\nhe chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,\n\nand bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is\n\nso satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening\n\nIn Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.\n\nEven when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-\n\nwatcher keeps up the exhilirating game.\n\nWith shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the\n\nstream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as\n\nThe water's edge.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a12\n\nEXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND\n\nDozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is\n\nstartled by a sound.\n\nHe sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his\n\nsenses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.\n\nNever in his life - already twice as long as most members of\n\nhis species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The\n\ngreat cats approached in silence, and the only thing that\n\nbetrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional\n\ncracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise\n\nthat grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous\n\nbeast was moving through the night, making no attempt at\n\nconcealment, and ignoring all obstacles.\n\nAnd then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not\n\npossibly have identified, for it had never been heard before\n\nin the history of this planet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a13\n\nA10\n\nEXT CAVE - NEW ROCK\n\nMoonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he\n\nleads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.\n\nHe had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing\n\nhad happened after that initial noise, so he does not even\n\nassociate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There\n\nis nothing in the least alarming about it.\n\nIt is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of\n\nsome completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy\n\nto see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.\n\nThere are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can\n\ncompare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious\n\nof most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.\n\nAs nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,\n\nhard surface.\n\nAfter several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a\n\nbrilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it\n\nmust have grown during the night. There are many plants\n\nthat do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that\n\nseem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that\n\nthey are small and round, whereas this is large and square;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a14\n\nA10\n\nCONTINUED\n\nbut greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be\n\nprepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.\n\nThis really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher\n\nto a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,\n\nround pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few\n\nthat made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?\n\nA few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.\n\nThere is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he\n\ncontinues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a15\n\nA11\n\nEXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON\n\nThey are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the\n\nsound begins.\n\nIt is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they\n\nstand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,\n\nmaddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube\n\nand hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first\n\ntime - and the last, for two million year - the sound of\n\ndrumming is heard in Africa.\n\nThe throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the\n\nhominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards\n\nthe source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little\n\ndancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that\n\ntheir descendants will not create for ages yet.\n\nTotally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting\n\nthe hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,\n\nand the hunger in their bellies.\n\nNow, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes\n\nfuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a16\n\nA11\n\nCONTINUED\n\nrotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-\n\neyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.\n\nThen by some magic - though it was no more magical than all\n\nthat had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It\n\nis as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and\n\nshifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four\n\nhominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's\n\nown tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog\n\nlies near them.\n\nThis little family of male and female and two children is gorged\n\nand replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a\n\ncondition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From\n\ntime to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the\n\nentrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.\n\nThe spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally\n\ndifferent scene.\n\nThe family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;\n\nit is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a17\n\nA11\n\nCONTINUED\n\nA small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids\n\nwithout giving them more than a glance, for they had never been\n\nthe slightest danger to its species.\n\nBut that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male\n\nsuddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -\n\nand hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon\n\nits skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had\n\nproduced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.\n\nAnd the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one\n\namazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.\n\nThen the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds\n\nitself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement\n\ncan be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the\n\npig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene\n\nfreezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless\n\nabove the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.\n\nThe scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a\n\nglimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a18\n\nA11\n\nCONTINUED\n\nawakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle\n\nback to their caves.\n\nThey have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that\n\nnight, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears\n\nattuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher\n\nfeels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge\n\nto kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a19\n\nA12\n\nEXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia\n\nBabies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-\n\nyear-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others\n\nthreatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.\n\nIn the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions\n\nhad changed almost beyond recognition.\n\nThey had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no\n\nlonger haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons\n\nwell; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that\n\nthe Cube had revealed to them.\n\nThey were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they\n\nhad time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.\n\nTheir new way of life was casually accepted, and they did\n\nnot associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing\n\noutside their cave.\n\nBut no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The\n\nfirst was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids\n\nseemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better\n\nnourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a20\n\nA12\n\nCONTINUED\n\nsomehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to\n\ndie of starvation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a21\n\nA13\n\nEXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION\n\nWith the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the\n\nground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-\n\nwatcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two\n\nconsecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,\n\nbetraying his presences by a small pebble slide.\n\nWhen they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,\n\nthey strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound\n\nof the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave\n\nagainst the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their\n\nstrength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.\n\nThe lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these\n\ncreatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost\n\nhim his life; he goes back to his meal.\n\nThe rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with\n\namazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about\n\nfifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.\n\nJust at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps\n\naway from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a22\n\nA13\n\nCONTINUED\n\nonrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-\n\nconfidence and bad luck.\n\nThe next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They\n\nalso find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to\n\nsee what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small\n\nrock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to\n\npay for such a great victory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  * * * * * * * *\n\nAnd then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even\n\nMoonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly\n\nunaware of all that it had done.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a23\n\nA14\n\nEXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD\n\nFrom their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of\n\ntheir own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen\n\nmales of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-\n\nlooking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.\n\nThe Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today\n\nsomething is different, though the Others do not immediatly\n\nrecognize this fact.\n\nInstead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,\n\nMoonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and\n\nbegin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness\n\nnever befor seen.\n\nAs the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the\n\nmorning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness\n\nof this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to\n\nan uneasy silence.\n\nAt the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They\n\ncarry their bone clubs and bone knives.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a24\n\nA14\n\nCONTINUED\n\nLed by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-\n\nchant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts\n\nthe sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their\n\nhearts.\n\nMoonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who\n\nwalked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his\n\nhand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is\n\nthe bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,\n\ndisplaying its frightful fangs.\n\nThe Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.\n\nMoonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.\n\nThen with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled\n\nstandard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed\n\nby his band.\n\nThe Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even\n\nthe ability to flee.\n\nMoonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a25\n\nA14\n\nCONTINUED\n\nunsurely in front of his band.\n\nThough he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,\n\nOne-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first\n\ndisplayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked\n\nwith a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club\n\nuntil the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness\n\ndown around him.\n\nThe Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.\n\nMoonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the\n\nworld, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would\n\nthink of something.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t a26\n\n\t\t\t\t\t    A SECTION TIMING\n\n\t\t\t    A1    00.30\n\n\t\t\t    A2    00.45\n\n\t\t\t    A3    01.30\n\n\t\t\t    A4    00.30\n\n\t\t\t    A5    01.00\n\n\t\t\t    A6    01.00\n\n\t\t\t    A7    01.00\n\n\t\t\t    A8    03.00\n\n\t\t\t    A9    00.45\n\n\t\t\t    A10   02.00\n\n\t\t\t    A11   04.00\n\n\t\t\t    A12   02.00\n\n\t\t\t    A13   02.30\n\n\t\t\t    A14   02.30\n\n\t\t\t\t\t    A SECTION TOTAL: @23 MIN. 00 SECS\n\n\t\t\t    TITLE\t\t\t\t\tPART II\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    YEAR 2001\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    a26a\n\nB1\n\nEARTH FROM 200 MILES UP\t\t\t\t\t NARRATOR\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    By the year 2001, overpopulation has\n\nB1a\t\t\t\t\t\t replaced the problem of starvation\n\nTHOUSAND MEGATON\t\t\t   but this was ominously offset by the\n\nNUCLEAR BOMB IN ORBIT\t\t   absolute and utter perfection of the\n\nABOVE THE EARTH,\t\t\t   weapon.\n\nRUSSIAN INSIGNIA AND\n\nCCCP MARKINGS\n\nB1b\t\t\t\t\t\t\t NARRATOR\n\nAMERICAN THOUSAND\t\t\t  Hundreds of giant bombs had been\n\nMEGATON BOMB IN ORBIT\t\t   placed in perpetual orbit above the\n\nABOVE THE EARTH.\t\t\t   Earth.
