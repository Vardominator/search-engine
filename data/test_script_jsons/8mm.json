They slow to a\n\n     finish, uneventfully, holding each other.  Their breathing\n\n     quiets.  Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.\n\n     Welles kisses his wife again, rolls off of her and sits on\n\n     the edge of the bed.  Amy covers herself. \n\n                             AMY\n\n                 I love you.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I love you. \n\n     He looks towards her in the dark.

I tried to warn\n\n                 my daughter, but what can you do? \n\n     The politician shakes his head in disgust.  Welles rises. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 The um... you'll find my invoice in\n\n                 the envelope.

Welles'\n\n     yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban\n\n     one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.\n\n     Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow.  One\n\n     of his neighbors is repainting a back porch.  The neighbor\n\n     waves.  Welles waves, resumes mowing. \n\n     INT.  BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT\n\n     MUSIC'S LOUD.  League Night.

One pin remains standing.\n\n     Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his\n\n     rowdy, mocking teammates.

Yes... could you hold on a\n\n                 minute...?\n\n     Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads\n\n     downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM... \n\n     INT.

You're very prompt.   \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 I try to be.\n\n     Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 I appreciate your coming on such\n\n                 short notice. \n\n     Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN\n\n                 This is Mister Longdale, my late\n\n                 husband's attorney. \n\n     Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 Uh huh, pleasure. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Apparently Mr. Longdale has\n\n                 something he feels he simply must\n\n                 say before you and I speak.\n\n                             LONGDALE \n\n                 Yes, I do have something to say.  I\n\n                 insisted on being here as soon as I\n\n                 heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 I'm listening. \n\n                             LONGDALE \n\n                 As Mr. Christian's attorney and one\n\n                 of the executors of his estate, it\n\n                 concerns me that a meeting of this\n\n                 sort should take place without my\n\n                 being asked to attend. \n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Of what sort? \n\n                             LONGDALE\n\n                 You are a private investigator? \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 That's right. \n\n                             LONGDALE \n\n                 Well, whatever reasons Mrs.\n\n                 Christian has for engaging the\n\n                 services of a private investigator,\n\n                 I should certainly be a party to.\n\n                 But, since she feels differently, I\n\n                 can only go on the record as having\n\n                 expressed my adamant disapproval. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone\n\n                 on the record, and now perhaps you\n\n                 should just be gone. \n\n     Longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Have a pleasant evening. \n\n                       (to Welles) \n\n                 Will you have tea, Mister Welles? \n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Thank you. \n\n     Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a\n\n     table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 He's odd.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 He's a lawyer.\n\n                       (offers tea)\n\n                 Please, sit, here...\n\n     Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 I've spoken to friends of mine and\n\n                 my husband's, in Harrisburg, in\n\n                 Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about\n\n                 you.  I must say you have friends in\n\n                 influential places. \n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I've been privileged to provide\n\n                 services for people I admire.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 You are highly recommended.  Praised\n\n                 for your discretion... your strict\n\n                 adherence to confidentiality. \n\n     Welles nods, sipping tea. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 As you know, my husband passed away\n\n                 recently.  Two weeks ago now.\n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 My condolences. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 His passing has left me with...\n\n                 something of a dilemma.  A terrible,\n\n                 terrible dilemma. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 I'll do whatever I can to help. \n\n     Mrs. Christian studies Welles.\n\n     INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT\n\n     Mrs. Christian and Welles enter.  This office has been lived\n\n     in for a lifetime.  Giant DESK.  AMERICAN FLAG.  Walls\n\n     covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,\n\n     baked enamel sign nailed up, \"\n\nCHRISTIAN STEEL.\n\n\" \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 His inner sanctum. \n\n     Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.\n\n     CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,\n\n     industrial landscape behind him. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Not many people have been inside\n\n                 this room. \n\n     Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various\n\n     STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,\n\n     shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 Pittsburgh? \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Mostly.  That's where he started his\n\n                 empire building.\n\n                       (looks up at portrait)\n\n                 He was a good man.  Notorious as an\n\n                 eccentric, but that was something he\n\n                 cultivated.  He \n\nwanted\n\n to be\n\n                 legendary.\n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 He succeeded. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 We were married forty-five years.\n\n                 Hard even for me to imagine.  We had\n\n                 our troubles.  There were plenty of\n\n                 places for him to be other than\n\n                 here, but he was always loyal to me,\n\n                 and I to him.  I loved him deeply.\n\n     Welles waits. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 I wear a gun when I can tell a\n\n                 client expects me to.  Other than\n\n                 that, there's never any reason. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Just curious. \n\n     Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a\n\n     WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 My husband was the only one with the\n\n                 combination to this safe.  I knew\n\n                 about it, but as far as I was\n\n                 concerned it was none of my\n\n                 business.  Not till now, that is. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 You hired someone to open it.  I'll\n\n                 bet the lawyer loved that.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 There was nothing he could do.  My\n\n                 husband left everything to me.\n\n                       (looks at safe)\n\n                 I prevented anyone from seeing the\n\n                 contents.  I felt these were my\n\n                 husband's private things.  I\n\n                 didn't... I didn't realize... \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 Do you want to tell me what you\n\n                 found? \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Cash, stock certificates, and this...\n\n     She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a\n\n     plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 It's a film... of a girl being\n\n                 murdered. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 I'm afraid I don't... \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 This is a movie showing a girl being\n\n                 murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,\n\n                 and a man rapes her... and he begins\n\n                 to cut her with a knife...\n\n                       (pause)\n\n                 I only watched what I could.\n\n     Welles picks up the film, looks at it. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 I didn't know what to think.  I\n\n                 can't tell you how horrible it's\n\n                 been, to know this belonged to my\n\n                 husband.  To know that he watched\n\n                 this... this atrocity.  But, I can't\n\n                 go to the police...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Mrs. Christian... please, will you\n\n                 sit down a moment? \n\n                       (leads her to a chair) \n\n                 I want you to listen carefully.\n\n                 What you're talking about is a\n\n                 \"snuff film.\"  But, from what I\n\n                 know, snuff films are a kind of...\n\n                 urban myth.  Like, red light\n\n                 district folklore.  There's no such\n\n                 thing, I can assure you. \n\n     Mrs. Christian shakes her head. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 Please, believe me.  This is\n\n                 probably a stag film.  Simulated\n\n                 rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might\n\n                 seem real, but there are ways of\n\n                 making it look realistic... fake\n\n                 blood and special effects...\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 No. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 If you were to study it you'd see\n\n                 the camera cutting away... you'd see\n\n                 the tricks they can play...\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 I'm telling you it's not that. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 I'm sure it is. \n\n                       (smiles) \n\n                 It's probably something your husband\n\n                 was given as a bad joke.  More than\n\n                 likely he never even watched it. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Will you watch it and see for\n\n                 yourself? \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 Of course.  But, I'm certain it's\n\n                 nothing to worry about. \n\n     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT \n\n     An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall.  Welles looks back to Mrs.\n\n     Christian in the doorway.  Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the\n\n     door.  Darkness.  Welles turns on the projector and sits.\n\n     The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...\n\n     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy\n\n     FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny\n\n     GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a\n\n     nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel\n\n     room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful\n\n     girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,\n\n     staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts\n\n     long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl\n\n     still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and\n\n     DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...\n\n     Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.\n\n     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a\n\n     bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.\n\n     The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with\n\n     eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.\n\n     He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,\n\n     pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems\n\n     to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and\n\n     the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole\n\n     CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor\n\n     the girl...\n\n     Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the\n\n     girl, knocking her back on the bed...\n\n     Welles grimaces.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated\n\n     position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes\n\n     closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs\n\n     to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his\n\n     fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs\n\n     away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked\n\n     Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid\n\n     out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...\n\n     Welles rises slowly, still watching.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves\n\n     back towards the girl...\n\n     Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.\n\nWE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM\n\n, but Welles\n\n     does.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs\n\n     involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his\n\n     fist to his mouth, breathing hard.\n\n     Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.\n\n     The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING.  Welles is sickened, sweating,\n\n     still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.\n\n     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Silence.  Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled.\n\n     The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the\n\n     dark, visibly shaken.  Mrs. Christian watches him, her\n\n     sorrow now shared.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 You... you need to go to the police. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 I told you I can't, not yet. \n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 You don't have any other choice. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                       (stands, shakes her head) \n\n                 No.  For me to live with the ruin of\n\n                 my husband's name, I need know that\n\n                 whoever did this will be punished.\n\n                 If you can find them, I will take\n\n                 their names to the police.  I'll say\n\n                 my husband confessed on his death\n\n                 bed. I'll say I didn't have courage\n\n                 to come forward at first...\n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 It won't work like that.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n\n                 Any evidence you collect can be\n\n                 given to the police later,\n\n                 anonymously.  I've thought about it\n\n                 and there's no other way.  If you\n\n                 can't find them... if the only thing\n\n                 that comes from this film is that\n\n                 this is all my husband will be\n\n                 remembered for, well I can't let\n\n                 that happen.  I'm telling you I\n\n                 won't.  If there's no chance that\n\n                 poor girl's memory can be served,\n\n                 then I'll just have to spend my last\n\n                 days trying to forget her. \n\n     Welles sits, rests his head in his hands. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 I deal in divorce cases.

Welles threads the 8MM FILM\n\n     into his enlarger, still in white gloves.\n\n     He flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways IMAGE down\n\n     onto the enlarger's baseboard, FOCUSING... it's the girl\n\n     sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film.\n\n     Welles makes an adjustment to the enlarger's lens; framing\n\n     tighter on the girl's face, REFOCUSING.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO\n\n     of the girl.  He props the photo up on a dresser, stands\n\n     looking at it.

What happened\n\n                 was they picked up a young girl\n\n                 hitchhiking off 81, which heads into\n\n                 Philadelphia, started up a\n\n                 conversation with this girl, she\n\n                 looked homeless, seemed about\n\n                 eighteen maybe.  They convinced her\n\n                 to let them buy her a meal in the\n\n                 city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have\n\n                 much to say, but they got a sense\n\n                 she's a runaway, so all through\n\n                 dinner the doctor's working on her,\n\n                 trying to convince her that at the\n\n                 very least she should pick up a\n\n                 telephone.  Not surprisingly, she\n\n                 ate her food, excused herself...\n\n                       (snaps fingers)\n\n                 That's the last they saw her.  The\n\n                 reason they came to me for help, the\n\n                 reason I'm coming to you, is we had\n\n                 a friend of mine in the department\n\n                 work up a sketch...\n\n                       (shows the POLICE ARTIST\n\n                        SKETCH he photocopied)\n\n                 They want to see if I can I.D. this\n\n                 girl, somehow pass along a message\n\n                 to let the parents know the kid's\n\n                 alive, doing alright.\n\n                             DIRECTOR \n\n                 Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or\n\n                 N.C.M.E.C.? \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 I figured you share information. \n\n                             DIRECTOR \n\n                 We do. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 For whatever reasons I thought you\n\n                 might be more receptive.\n\n                             DIRECTOR \n\n                 Why don't they come to me? \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 This doctor and wife, they're nice\n\n                 people, but they don't want to get\n\n                 too involved.  They're not trying to\n\n                 have the parents come looking for\n\n                 the girl either. \n\n                 You and I both know sometimes, not\n\n                 often, but sometimes there's real\n\n                 reasons why a kid'll run. \n\n                 Molestation, whatever.  Besides\n\n                 that, the girl's probably eighteen,\n\n                 so she's legal.\n\n                             DIRECTOR \n\n                 I'm not so sure about this. \n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 They're putting themselves in place\n\n                 of this kid's parents and thinking\n\n                 they'd want to hear their girl's\n\n                 okay, even if that's all they hear. \n\n                             DIRECTOR\n\n                 I can give you my card, if your\n\n                 clients want to call me... \n\n     Welles accepts a CARD, disappointed.\n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 They were pretty clear they didn't\n\n                 want this coming back on them.\n\n                             DIRECTOR \n\n                 Well, that's all I can do.

Two are\n\n                 obvious; the man in the mask and the\n\n                 man running the camera, but I caught\n\n                 a glimpse of a third man in a\n\n                 mirror.  It's nothing that can be\n\n                 used for identification, but he was\n\n                 there, watching...\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses\n\n     his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame,\n\n     till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table\n\n     with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out...\n\n     Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME.\n\n                             WELLES (V.O., cont)\n\n                 So, there were three.  They would\n\n                 have kept it small, wouldn't have\n\n                 let anyone in on it they didn't have\n\n                 to.  That's all for now... except,\n\n                 I feel I should tell you... with\n\n                 this looking like it happened at\n\n                 least five or six years ago...\n\n     Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the\n\n     Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades.\n\n                             WELLES (V.O., cont)\n\n                 Well, it's not very likely we'll\n\n                 ever find out who this girl was. \n\n                       (listens) \n\n                 I will, I'll keep trying.

Grainy and\n\n     hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.\n\n     INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE\n\n     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger,\n\n     projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard.\n\n     He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING...\n\n     the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR\n\n     tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand.\n\n     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,\n\n     drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of\n\n     MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one...\n\n     Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's\n\n     director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving.\n\n     Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK:\n\n     TITLE CARD:      \n\nthree weeks later\n\n     EXT.

MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled \"\n\nNorth\n\n     Carolina 1992,\n\n\" flipping through picture cards.  The FACES\n\n     of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed\n\n     GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL\n\n     with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress...\n\n     a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...\n\n     Welles furrows his brow.\n\n     He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair.\n\n     Welles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands\n\n     shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed\n\n     of the girl from the snuff film.  It's her.\n\n     Welles compares the two pictures.  She's prettier in the\n\n     card catalog photo, but it's her.\n\n     Welles can't believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other\n\n     files don't even know he's there.  Welles pulls out his\n\n     notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...\n\n     Writing the girl's name: \"\n\nMary Anne Matthews.\n\n\"\n\n     EXT.

Your\n\n                 husband... he committed suicide?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 Yes.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 September 4th, 1993.  About a year\n\n                 after Mary disappeared.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 We were divorced by then.  Things\n\n                 fell apart... he was living with a\n\n                 friend...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Why do you think he did it?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 It got to be too much for him.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 You have to forgive me, but in these\n\n                 circumstances... with your\n\n                 daughter...\n\n                       (pause)\n\n                 Were there any indications of... any\n\n                 sort of abuse?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 There wasn't anything like that.\n\n                 The police and the FBI people asked,\n\n                 but there wasn't anything happened\n\n                 like that, never.  My husband... his\n\n                 heart broke when Mary left...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I didn't mean to...\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 You try going through what we did.\n\n                 Bob couldn't take it, that's all.\n\n                 Christ, there's times when it still\n\n                 seems like I can't either.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I had to ask.  I apologize.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 No one knows what it's like.  You\n\n                 can't even imagine how much it hurts. \n\n     Welles is miserable.  A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at\n\n     Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 People remember me from the news.\n\n                       (pause)\n\n                 Can you drive me back now?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Of course. \n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Mrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. \n\n     This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS\n\n     of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink\n\n     sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 This is her room.\n\n     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.\n\n     Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a\n\n     collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 The police made a wreck of it, but\n\n                 I put it back exactly how it was.\n\n                 Just how she likes it.\n\n     Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK\n\n     where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 Those are for her birthday.  One for\n\n                 every year she's missed.  They'll be\n\n                 waiting for her when she comes back. \n\n     Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide\n\n     it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I... I shouldn't take anymore of\n\n                 your time.  Maybe we can finish\n\n                 tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 Okay.\n\n     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles escapes to his car, climbing in.  He starts it up...\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes.  He has to pull\n\n     over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles has unpacked.  He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (into phone)\n\n                 You should be able to take a shower\n\n                 and still have hot water left, honey.\n\n                       (listens)\n\n                 Call him back and tell him I said\n\n                 so.  The goddamn thing's still under\n\n                 warranty.\n\n                       (listens)\n\n                 I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's\n\n                 hard.\n\n                       (listens)\n\n                 I've got a lead I have to follow\n\n                 through.  To be honest, I don't\n\n                 think I'm going to get very far.\n\n                 I miss you.  I love you.\n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING\n\n     Welles sits at the kitchen table.  Mrs. Mathews makes\n\n     coffee.  The home's decor is cheap and flowery.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS \n\n                 We weren't religious.  We never\n\n                 forced religion down her throat,\n\n                 like I've seen some parents do to\n\n                 their kids.  We never made her go to\n\n                 church.  But, after Mary was gone,\n\n                 that's when I got religious.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 Doesn't make much sense, does it?\n\n                 When everything's happy, when life's\n\n                 fine and you have every reason to\n\n                 believe there's a God, you don't\n\n                 bother.  Then, something horrible\n\n                 happens... that's when you start\n\n                 praying all the time.  That's when\n\n                 you start going to church.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 We're all like that.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 Are you religious?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 No.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 You should be.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I've got what I need for my report.\n\n                 There is... there is one thing that\n\n                 bothers me though.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 What? \n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 It's not really my place, but it's\n\n                 not easy for me to set aside the\n\n                 private detective part of me either.\n\n                 See, I know a little about missing\n\n                 persons.  When kids run, they almost\n\n                 always leave a note.  It's guilt.\n\n                 They want to say goodbye.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 There wasn't one.  The police looked.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Do you think the police did a good\n\n                 job?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 I don't know.  I think so.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 It is possible... and I know this\n\n                 isn't something you want to hear.\n\n                 Your daughter may have tried to hide\n\n                 a note where she thought you would\n\n                 eventually find it, but where she\n\n                 knew your husband would never find\n\n                 it.  She might have wanted to tell\n\n                 you something...\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 No.  You don't have any reason to\n\n                 think that...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 If the police focused their search\n\n                 in \n\nher\n\n room, \n\nher\n\n belongings, well\n\n                 that'd be only natural, but they may\n\n                 have been looking in the wrong place.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews is getting upset.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 How... how can you say that to me...?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Will you let me look?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 My husband never laid a hand on her.\n\n                 She would have told me... she would\n\n                 have told me...\n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 You're probably right, and I\n\n                 probably won't find anything.\n\n                 I don't have a right to ask this,\n\n                 and you can kick me out of your\n\n                 house if you want, but this is my\n\n                 profession and there's a part of me\n\n                 that can't let it go.  Police are\n\n                 just as human as you or I.  They\n\n                 could have missed something.  They\n\n                 probably didn't.\n\n                       (pause)\n\n                 Wouldn't you rather know?\n\n     Mrs. Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 Go ahead and look if you want.  I\n\n                 don't care what you do.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews gets up and walks out of the room.\n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- SEARCH MONTAGE -- DAY\n\n     -In MRS. MATHEWS' BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER\n\n      drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was...\n\n      searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes\n\n      BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...\n\n     -In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE\n\n      CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens\n\n      CABINETS under the sink...\n\n     -In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair,\n\n      staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch\n\n      on TV tray beside her, drink in hand.\n\n     -In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high\n\n      CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls\n\n      out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...\n\n     -Welles stands in the doorway of MARY'S ROOM, just stares.\n\n      He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the\n\n      ceiling.  There's an ATTIC DOOR there.  Welles reaches to\n\n      the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...\n\n      -In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT,\n\n      crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES\n\n      of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents...\n\n      Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large\n\n      WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...\n\n      Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS\n\n      in mothballs.  He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,\n\n      opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.\n\n      He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.\n\n      Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.\n\n      Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: \"\n\nMary Anne Mathews.\n\n\"\n\n      Welles turns pages.  The DIARY'S about half-full of\n\n      feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written\n\n      page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged\n\n      edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the\n\n      very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.  Welles sits and reads...\n\n                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)\n\n                       (emotionless monotone)\n\n                 \"Dear mom.  If you're reading this,\n\n                 it means I called you from\n\n                 Hollywood, California and told you\n\n                 where to find my diary.  I don't\n\n                 think I'll be able to tell you this\n\n                 when I talk to you, so I'm writing\n\n                 it down here.  You know I haven't\n\n                 been happy for a long, long time.\n\n                 For a long time now dad's been doing\n\n                 things I couldn't tell you.  He's\n\n                 been touching me and it's getting\n\n                 worse.  I can't stay anymore.  I\n\n                 know you and I haven't always gotten\n\n                 along sometimes, but please don't\n\n                 blame yourself.  There isn't\n\n                 anything you can do.  I'm going to\n\n                 make a whole new life in California.\n\n                 Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or\n\n                 in magazines.  Don't worry about me.\n\n                 Love, Mary Anne.\"\n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles shuts the attic door, takes the DIARY from his\n\n     pocket, hides it in his waistband at the small of his back.\n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles enters.  Mrs. Mathews looks up from the TV.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 You were right.\n\n                       (pause)\n\n                 I didn't find anything.

COPY SHOP -- LATE DAY\n\n     Welles uses a self-serve COPY MACHINE, flattening the DIARY\n\n     on the glass, photocopying the DIARY as quickly as he can.\n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles sits picking at fast food in front of him.  Mrs.\n\n     Mathews' food isn't even unwrapped. \n\n     She's numb from her drink, watching a GAME SHOW, smoking. \n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Do you ever consider... do you\n\n                 realize that Mary may never come\n\n                 back?\n\n     Mrs. Mathews looks to Welles, looks back at the TV.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 I think about it everyday.  But,\n\n                 every time the phone rings... every\n\n                 single time, I still think it's her.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 It's been six years.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 What am I supposed to do?

A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an\n\n     examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.\n\n     In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,\n\n     obviously masturbating.

Then,\n\n                 there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple\n\n                 X.  The difference is penetration.\n\n                 That's hardcore.  That whole\n\n                 industry's up in the valley.\n\n                 Writers, directors, porn stars.\n\n                 They're celebrities, or they think\n\n                 they are.  They pump out 150 videos\n\n                 a week.  A \n\nweek\n\n.  They've even got\n\n                 a porno Academy Awards.  America\n\n                 loves pornography.  Anybody tells\n\n                 you they never use pornography,\n\n                 they're lying.  Somebody's buying\n\n                 those videos.  Somebody's out there\n\n                 spending 900 million dollars a year\n\n                 on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's\n\n                 only gonna get worse.  More and more\n\n                 you'll see perverse hardcore coming\n\n                 into the mainstream, because that's\n\n                 evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my\n\n                 God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his\n\n                 hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,\n\n                 Mtv's showing girls dancing around\n\n                 in thong bikinis with their asses\n\n                 hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For\n\n                 the porn-addict, big tits aren't big\n\n                 enough after a while.  They have to\n\n                 be the biggest tits ever.

Soon, Playboy is gonna be\n\n                 Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,\n\n                 Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore\n\n                 films'll be medical films.\n\n                 People'll be jerking off to women\n\n                 laying around with open wounds.\n\n                 There's nowhere else for it to go.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Interesting theory.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 What you saw tonight, we're not\n\n                 talking about a video some dentist\n\n                 takes home over the weekend.  We're\n\n                 talking about stuff where people get\n\n                 hurt.  Specialty product. \n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Child pornography.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 There's two kinds of specialty\n\n                 product; legal and illegal.  Foot\n\n                 fetish, shit films, watersports,\n\n                 bondage, spanking, fisting, she-\n\n                 males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond\n\n                 hardcore, but legal.  This is the\n\n                 kind of hardcore where one guy's\n\n                 going to look at it and throw up,\n\n                 another guy looks at it and falls in\n\n                 love.  Now, with some of the S+M and\n\n                 bondage films, they straddle the\n\n                 line.  How are you supposed to tell\n\n                 if the person tied up with the ball\n\n                 gag in their mouth is a consenting\n\n                 or not?  Step over that line, you're\n\n                 into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but\n\n                 there aren't many.

Who do you see?\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 First of all, basement sales like\n\n                 tonight aren't gonna last much\n\n                 longer.  It's too risky, one, and\n\n                 two, everything's going on the\n\n                 internet.  Anyone with a computer\n\n                 and enough patience can find\n\n                 anything he wants.  It's heaven for\n\n                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.\n\n                 They're swapping pictures back and\n\n                 forth as fast as their modems can\n\n                 zap 'em.  But, there's still some\n\n                 weird shit under the counter where\n\n                 I work sometimes.  No one knows where\n\n                 it comes from.  That's local\n\n                 underground, where information\n\n                 spreads by word of mouth.  Those are\n\n                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their\n\n                 hands are permanently pruned.  They\n\n                 go out in the sun they don't burn,\n\n                 they blister.  Other than that, all\n\n                 I know about is the mail.\n\n                 Classified ads in the paper with\n\n                 hidden codes.  Secret couriers.\n\n                 Credit card orders to dummy\n\n                 corporations.  Interstate wire\n\n                 transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.\n\n                 But, if you're asking me who do you\n\n                 go to to get illegal shit... who\n\n                 knows?  That's the whole point --\n\n                 the seller stays as far away from\n\n                 the buyer as possible, and vice\n\n                 versa, and cops can't trace the\n\n                 deal.  There's ways to do it so\n\n                 nobody knows who anybody is.\n\n     Welles watches Max eat.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 How old are you?\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 Twenty-five.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Where are your parents?\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 I don't know, where are yours?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I don't mean any offense... but what\n\n                 are you doing mixed up in all this?\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 I'm not mixed up in anything,\n\n                 hayseed.

Welles places a massive tome\n\n     down on a table:  \"\n\nHaines Criss-Cross Directory.\n\n\"\n\n     Welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone\n\n     number written: \"\n\n(212) 555-9906.\n\n\"  He opens the reference\n\n     book, searching pages...\n\n     Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each\n\n     with an address.  Welles runs his finger down the page.\n\n     EXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY\n\n     PEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY\n\n     TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles\n\n     walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder\n\n     with other buildings, labeled \"\n\n1204\n\n\" in burnished steel.\n\n     Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.\n\n     The top button's labeled \"Greystone Imports,\" the bottom\n\n     button reads \"Lang Interior Design, by appt.\"  The middle\n\n     button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.\n\n     Welles looks up at the building.\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY\n\n     The sun is low.  Less activity on the street.  Welles leans\n\n     against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.\n\n     TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed\n\n     in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel\n\n     bags.  They start up the stairs of 1204...\n\n     Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.\n\n     The women hit the center button.  A BUZZER sounds as they\n\n     head inside.  Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the\n\n     door before it closes.\n\n     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY\n\n     Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR.  One\n\n     woman hits \"2.\"  Welles hits \"3,\" steps back in the corner.\n\n     Elevator doors creak closed.  The two women are heavily made\n\n     up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.\n\n     Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises\n\n     through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.\n\n     Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR.  The two women get\n\n     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS\n\n     painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.\n\n     The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another\n\n     dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter.  The low rumble of\n\n     HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.\n\n     Welles lets the elevator close.\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR.  Welles gets out,\n\n     instead of leaving the way he came, heads towards the\n\n     rear... FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with\n\n     fire escapes above.  There's a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing.\n\n     Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.\n\n     Welles looks to make sure he's alone.  He starts tearing\n\n     open GARBAGE BAGS.  Flies swarm.  One bag's filled with\n\n     empty food containers and old newspapers.\n\n     Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT\n\n     LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER\n\n     PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS.  He pulls out a\n\n     few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...\n\n     The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures\n\n     chopped out from many pages.

MOTEL, HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     A TAXI pulls over in front of this flea-bag motel.  Max gets\n\n     out with a SUITCASE, looks at the dubious accommodations.\n\n     INT.  MOTEL, MAX'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Max enters with Welles, turns on a light and throws his\n\n     suitcase on the bed.  The room is disgusting.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 You didn't say it was gonna be this\n\n                 luxurious.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 It's their Presidential Suite.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 Great.\n\n     Max looks in the bathroom.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 Oh, come on, man, what are we doing\n\n                 in this flea bag?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 It's cheap, and people know to mind\n\n                 their own business. What have you\n\n                 got for me? \n\n     Max opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES.\n\n     He hands them to Welles.  The boxes are covered in jumbled\n\n     PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull,\n\n     mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 Dino Velvet.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN.  WE\n\n     SEE NOTHING.  We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN\n\n     from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain.\n\n     Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.\n\n     Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a\n\n     VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet\n\n     TAPE, puts it in, sits.\n\n     ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of\n\n     Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a\n\n     sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...\n\n     Welles opens another beer.\n\n     ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the\n\n     ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by\n\n     candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in\n\n     slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound\n\n     woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.\n\n     He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...\n\n     This focuses Welles' attention.\n\n     ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Max... wake up...\n\n     Max awakens, rolling over, groggy.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 Wha... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (points at TV)\n\n                 Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?\n\n     Max tries to see, eyes barely open.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 He's one of the lunatics Dino uses.\n\n                 He's in a bunch of these.\n\n     Welles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket\n\n     shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,\n\n     thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. \n\n                             MAX\n\n                 Why?  He have something to do with\n\n                 whatever you're into?\n\n     Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.\n\n     ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 No... it's nothing... that's not him.\n\n     Welles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching.\n\n     ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her\n\n     hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...\n\n     CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.\n\n     He pulls down the woman's blindfold...\n\n     Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...\n\n     Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV\n\n     FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...\n\n     ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.\n\n     FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch\n\n     between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked\n\n     Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Who is he?\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 I told you, he's one of Dino\n\n                 Velvet's stock players...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Who is he, his \n\nname\n\n?\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 Nobody knows his name.  That's his\n\n                 thing.  He always wears a mask.  You\n\n                 never see his face.  He calls\n\n                 himself \"Machine,\" that's what they\n\n                 call him.  Machine. \n\n     Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and\n\n     down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with\n\n     fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 They say he's half brain-dead from\n\n                 all the steroids he's using.\n\n     Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He\n\n                 loves what he does for a living. \n\n     INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK\n\n     BOX.  At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the\n\n     MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in\n\n     thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.\n\n     Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the\n\n     combination, opens it.  He takes out the holster, stands\n\n     looking down at the gun.  He puts the holster on.\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on.  A car pulls out of\n\n     a parking space.  Welles takes the space.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY\n\n     Max is in the passenger seat.  Welles looks to 1204.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 You don't need to be here.\n\n                             MAX\n\n                 What kind of Junior P.I. would I be\n\n                 if I didn't go with you?\n\n     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY\n\n     Welles and Max get off the elevator, moving down the grey\n\n     hall, to the black doors.  Welles pushes the INTERCOM\n\n     BUTTON.  After a moment, the INTERCOM CRACKLES...\n\n                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n\n                       (from intercom)\n\n                 Who is it?\n\n     Welles waits, presses the button again.\n\n     INT.  DINO VELVET STUDIO -- DAY\n\n     The doors BUZZ and Welles and Max warily enter this large,\n\n     dark, converted warehouse.  Square pillars shoot from floor\n\n     to ceiling.  Shafts of light cut down from high windows.\n\n     A large THUG in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far DESK.\n\n                             THUG\n\n                 You're in the wrong place.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 We're looking for Mr. Velvet.\n\n                             THUG\n\n                 He's not here. \n\n     Welles looks around, at piles of PROPS; a huge faux-stone\n\n     ANGEL and GARGOYLES, elaborate CANDELABRAS, a huge BIRDCAGE,\n\n     massive WOODEN CROSS, NAZI FLAGS.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Why don't you tell him we're here to\n\n                 give him a large sum of money.  If\n\n                 he's not interested, we'll go.\n\n                             THUG\n\n                 You should leave now, before I have\n\n                 to remove you.\n\n     Welles just stands looking at the thug.  A VOICE is HEARD...\n\n                             DINO VELVET'S VOICE (V.O.)\n\n                       (from SPEAKERS)\n\n                 Show them in, Milo.\n\n     Welles and Max look up.  There are SPEAKERS mounted high up\n\n     on the pillars, and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS looking down.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 You heard the boss, Milo.\n\n     The disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards\n\n     a distant DOOR.  Welles and Max follow...\n\n     They notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a TORTURE\n\n     CHAMBER, complete with RACK and IRON MAIDEN.\n\n     INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\n     Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in.\n\n     The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of\n\n     PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned\n\n     up to form an indecipherable collage.  A tall LADDER leans\n\n     against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS.\n\n     DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man,\n\n     wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Come in.  Make yourself comfortable.\n\n     Welles shakes Dino's hand.  Max looks up at the walls.\n\n     IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy\n\n     photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 It's an honor to meet you.

BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY\n\n     A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied\n\n     buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles\n\n     drives through, watchful.\n\n     Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.\n\n     He parks the car.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY\n\n     Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.\n\n     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all\n\n     directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...\n\n     INT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to\n\n     the darkness.  A vast, empty space looms before him.\n\n     In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a\n\n     powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 There you are.  Come join us.\n\n     There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is\n\n     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M\n\n     harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.\n\n     Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.\n\n     Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the\n\n     warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS\n\n     propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...\n\n     Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE.  As Welles gets\n\n     closer, he notices several things ... \n\n     ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along\n\n     with several movie LIGHTS\n\n     ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside\n\n     a pair of HANDCUFFS...\n\n     ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...\n\n     Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his\n\n     distance.  Dino's still firing arrows at the target.\n\n     Machine's still staring at Welles.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (to Machine)\n\n                 Hello.\n\n     Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 You brought the money?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (takes out envelope)\n\n                 Right here.\n\n     Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then\n\n     turns to look at Welles with a smile.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Excellent.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Where are the women?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 They should be here any minute.\n\n     Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the\n\n     table, beside Bowie knifes.  He's sweating.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (of the knifes)\n\n                 What are these for?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just\n\n                 props.  Nice, aren't they?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Sure.\n\n     Dino walks across towards the target.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Machine and I were just talking\n\n                 about knifes.  The beauty of\n\n                 knifes...\n\n     Dino pulls arrows from the target.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 He was saying how fascinated he is\n\n                 by their simple ability to be sharp.\n\n                 The ability of a piece of metal to\n\n                 be so thin that it is almost\n\n                 nothing...\n\n     Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the\n\n     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 So close to nothingness that it cuts\n\n                 with minimum effort, because it's so\n\n                 non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It\n\n                 blooms open as the blade widens, but\n\n                 by then it's too late, because the\n\n                 knife's already doing its pure,\n\n                 simple damage.\n\n     Dino shoots another arrow to the target.\n\n     A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the\n\n     warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted\n\n     windows drives in...\n\n     The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays\n\n     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Ah, ours guests have arrived.\n\n     Machine stands.  He is a giant.\n\n     Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.\n\n     The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.\n\n     Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at\n\n     the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Mister Welles... would you be so\n\n                 kind as to remove any firearms from\n\n                 your person?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 What are you... ?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Take out your gun!\n\n     Welles brings his hand towards his holster...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Slowly.  Let me see it.\n\n     Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...\n\n     The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can't tell who he\n\n     is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Empty the gun onto the table, very\n\n                 carefully.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Look, I don't know what this...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,\n\n                 or I'll put this arrow through your\n\n                 throat.\n\n     Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.\n\n     The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer.  It's Eddie Poole.\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 Is that him?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                       (to Welles)\n\n                 Put the gun down, take the\n\n                 handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the\n\n                 bed.\n\n     Welles obeys, walks to the bed.\n\n     Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the\n\n     other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                       (still to Welles)\n\n                 Didn't know what to make of you at\n\n                 first, and you certainly had Eddie\n\n                 on pins and needles.  But, lo and\n\n                 behold, from out of the blue came an\n\n                 old business acquaintance to explain\n\n                 everything...\n\n     Welles looks across to the car...\n\n     The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the\n\n     wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 This is the fucker?  Motherfucker,\n\n                 doesn't look like anything...\n\n     Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches\n\n     him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward...\n\n     PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head.\n\n     Welles goes down, clutching his face.\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 Doesn't look like shit.\n\n     Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,\n\n     frisking him from head to toe.\n\n     Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a\n\n     tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up,\n\n     holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                     (to Welles)\n\n                 You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I remember him.\n\n                             LONGDALE\n\n                 Let's get this over with.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Fine idea.\n\n     Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 You're going to go get the film you\n\n                 received from Mrs. Christian, bring\n\n                 it here and put it in my hand.

Machine throws him to the floor.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 No...\n\n     Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the\n\n     handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Friend of yours?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Look, he's got nothing to do with\n\n                 this... let him go...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Can you guess what I'm going to say\n\n                 next?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 He doesn't know anything... he's got\n\n                 nothing to do with this...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n\n                 Bring the film, or we kill him.\n\n     Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I'll get it.

BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the\n\n     abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center\n\n     with attached wings of rooms on both sides.\n\n     The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out\n\n     skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is\n\n     boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.\n\n     IN THE LOT\n\n     Welles turns out headlights and parks.\n\n     He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.\n\n     HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the\n\n     forest as the CAR PASSES.\n\n     Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.\n\n     Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.\n\n     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.\n\n     Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles\n\n     pushes Eddie forward, gun out.\n\n     Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the\n\n     room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room's\n\n     empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.\n\n     Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  This is\n\n     where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the\n\n     snuff film, without the furniture.\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 What are we doing here?\n\n     Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on\n\n     Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...\n\n     The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and\n\n     Welles' palely lit face.\n\n                             WELLES \n\n                 That night... you didn't have to be\n\n                 in the room, but you were.\n\n                       (looks to Eddie)\n\n                 Why?  Why did you watch?\n\n     Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 I don't know.  I felt like it.  I\n\n                 never saw anyone get done before.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 You enjoy it? \n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 Made me sick, but what did I care?\n\n                 What did I care if some hump wants\n\n                 to beat off to that.  It was just\n\n                 something I was doing for money.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Tell me what happened.\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 What do you want to know?

This\n\n                 place was a shit-hole.  I backed up\n\n                 the car to the door and we carried\n\n                 her in, like groceries.  Dino made\n\n                 her eat a bunch of pills, we laid\n\n                 out the plastic, put film in the\n\n                 camera and Machine went to work.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 What did you do with her body?\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 Took it out the bathroom window.\n\n                 Buried it in the woods.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Show me.\n\n     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned\n\n     motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and\n\n     flashlight, into the dense forest...\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 What are you thinking you're gonna\n\n                 do... ?\n\n     Welles shoves Eddie ahead.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 Keep moving.\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 Where do you think you're taking\n\n                 this, huh?

Show me where.\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 I fucking don't know.  What do you\n\n                 think... we weren't burying\n\n                 treasure.  We didn't pace it out so\n\n                 we could come back and get it.  We\n\n                 dug a hole and we put her in it.\n\n                 Your guess is as good as mine.\n\n     Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his\n\n     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.\n\n                             EDDIE\n\n                 You'll never find her.  Nobody ever\n\n                 will, and even if they did, it\n\n                 doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the\n\n                 cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em\n\n                 all.  Without the film, it never\n\n                 happened.  Don't you get it?  It's\n\n                 over.  You can't do anything.\n\n     Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                 I can kill you.

Fucking do it!\n\n     Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's\n\n     forehead, pulls back the hammer... \n\n     Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.\n\n     Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage\n\n     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...\n\n     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Eddie's thrown face down to the floor.

He opens the glove compartment, finds\n\n     cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.\n\n     He looks back to the motel room.\n\n     He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR\n\n     PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at\n\n     it in his hand.\n\n     IN THE LOT\n\n     Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,\n\n     staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.\n\n     Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.\n\n     He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,\n\n     pages through, studies one page.\n\n     Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,\n\n     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)\n\n                       (from phone)\n\n                 Hello... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (into phone)\n\n                 Mrs. Mathews?

A CAR is HEARD, getting\n\n     LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.\n\n     Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying\n\n     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered\n\n     red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.\n\n     Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and\n\n     goes to his car...\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun\n\n     into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his\n\n     shirt, revolted.

EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.  He\n\n     gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the\n\n     headlights off.  BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle\n\n     HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.\n\n     INT.  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a\n\n     CHECK-IN COUNTER. \n\n     The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her\n\n     COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.\n\n     Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...\n\n     Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.\n\n                             AGENT\n\n                 There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed\n\n                 through to Kennedy.

MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,\n\n     white pages, finds... \"\n\nHOSPITALS.\n\n\"\n\n     Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (into phone)\n\n                 Hello, can you connect me with the\n\n                 duty nurse?\n\n                      (waits)\n\n                 Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson\n\n                 down here in the Thirteenth\n\n                 Precinct.  I've got a helluva\n\n                 problem I was hoping you could give\n\n                 me a hand with.  We had a stabbing\n\n                 incident a couple of days ago, and\n\n                 it looks like the supposed victim\n\n                 gave us a false name and address.\n\n                 Can you tell me if you had an adult\n\n                 male with an abdominal wound in you\n\n                 ER in the last forty-eight hours?\n\n                       (listens)\n\n                 You'd remember this guy; a body-\n\n                 builder, real big guy, five foot\n\n                 eleven, with acne all over his chest\n\n                 and back...\n\n                       (listens)\n\n                 Alright, thanks for your help. \n\n     Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the\n\n     phone book, starts dialing the next number.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.

You'd know him\n\n                 if you saw him... \n\n     Light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  Welles\n\n     paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (into phone)\n\n                 He's a body-builder, stands just\n\n                 under six feet...\n\n     Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (into phone)\n\n                 That's right... covered in acne.\n\n                 That's him, that's the guy.

He starts\n\n     feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone\n\n     book, searching, looks under the desk...\n\n     Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.\n\n                             WELLES\n\n                       (into phone)\n\n                 Yes... yes.\n\n                       (sits, writing in pad)\n\n                 Christopher Higgins.  Thirty-\n\n                 fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.\n\n                 Where?  Astoria, Queens.\n\n     Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.\n\n     EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY\n\n     A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two\n\n     story affairs, close together, each very much like its\n\n     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.\n\n     Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in\n\n     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.\n\n     Welles parallel parks.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles turns off the engine.\n\n     He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The\n\n     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,\n\n     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a\n\n     GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.\n\n     Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children\n\n     pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his\n\n     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side\n\n     mirror, rolling up the window.\n\n     Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,\n\n     pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG\n\n     off the passenger seat and opens it.\n\n     He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink\n\n     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.\n\n     Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles\n\n     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along\n\n     the gun's inner barrel.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY\n\n     Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.\n\n     He looks in his side mirror...\n\n     There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn\n\n     signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.\n\n     The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint\n\n     house begins to open. \n\n     Welles watches...\n\n     Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back\n\n     of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine.\n\n     Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.\n\n     The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's\n\n     garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the\n\n     garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the\n\n     sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.\n\n     Welles watches.\n\n     The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.\n\n     The garage door closes behind her.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one\n\n     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.\n\n     Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.\n\n     At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture\n\n     window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old\n\n     woman comes to sit at a table.\n\n     Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...\n\n     THROUGH BINOCULARS\n\n     The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.\n\n     She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of\n\n     her.  After a moment, someone joins her...\n\n     It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge\n\n     forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our\n\n     view, so we never see his face.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.\n\n     Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen\n\n     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old\n\n     woman smiles up at him, says something.\n\n     Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,\n\n     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.\n\n     Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a\n\n     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman\n\n     starts to eat.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY\n\n     Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,\n\n     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.\n\n     Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He\n\n     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.\n\n     ACROSS THE STREET\n\n     The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...\n\n     The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's\n\n     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.\n\n     Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.\n\n     ON THE STREET\n\n     Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind\n\n     him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all\n\n     directions, making sure no one's around.\n\n     Ahead, the garage door begins to close.\n\n     Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too\n\n     conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down...\n\n     Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get\n\n     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.\n\n     ABOVE\n\n     In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out\n\n     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.\n\n     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY\n\n     Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.\n\n     The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves\n\n     towards the door to the house.\n\n     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY\n\n     Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, \n\nseen only from behind\n\n, comes\n\n     to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push\n\n     clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,\n\n     taking out the WRESTLING MASK.\n\n     Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.\n\n     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY\n\n     Welles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is\n\n     small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING\n\n     MACHINE. \n\n     SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two\n\n     metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...\n\n     He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There's a\n\n     WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,\n\n     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n     Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his\n\n     gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.\n\n     It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT\n\n     WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL\n\n     FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.\n\n     INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the\n\n     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of\n\n     Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.\n\n     He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old\n\n     woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,\n\n     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into\n\n     the living room area...\n\n     Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear\n\n     plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.\n\n     Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.\n\n     Welles creeps up the stairs...\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.\n\n     He opens the door.  It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and\n\n     SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.\n\n     Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS\n\n     ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...\n\n     INT.  MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There's a\n\n     constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child's,\n\n     except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and\n\n     COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There's a RECORD\n\n     PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the\n\n     turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...\n\n     Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...\n\n     Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...\n\n     DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the\n\n     stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.\n\n     INT.  GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles stays near the door, looks around.  There's a fuzzy\n\n     sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.\n\n     Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.\n\n     Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles turns...\n\n     Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE\n\n     KNIFE raised to kill...\n\n     Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...\n\n     Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife.  Machine\n\n     grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...\n\n     Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand\n\n     pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...\n\n     BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine's grunts, pushing the\n\n     knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...\n\n     Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible\n\n     knife is inches away...\n\n     Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance\n\n     from the blade...\n\n     Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the\n\n     swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins\n\n     twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...\n\n     Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...\n\n     Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun\n\n     towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...\n\n     The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...\n\n     Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,\n\n     FIRES his gun...\n\n     The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!\n\n     Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free\n\n     hand to Welles' throat, choking him.  Welles' face reddens,\n\n     bleeding from bullet fragments...\n\n     Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.\n\n     Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed\n\n     effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...\n\n     SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...\n\n     The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. \n\n     Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'\n\n     throat.  Welles can't break the grip...\n\n     Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the\n\n     mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...\n\n     Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!\n\n     Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already\n\n     wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...\n\n     Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles\n\n     to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...\n\n     Machine rises, charging after...\n\n     ON THE STAIRCASE\n\n     Welles is TACKLED from behind...\n\n     Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the\n\n     wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...\n\n     Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the\n\n     living room.  Machine rises to give chase...\n\n     Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...\n\n     Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips\n\n     another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...\n\n     Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,\n\n     pushes Machine back, letting go...\n\n     Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands\n\n     and knees, scrambling...\n\n     Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...\n\n     Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING\n\n     down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...\n\n     Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,\n\n     extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...\n\n     Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...\n\n     Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...\n\n     Machine gets to his feet...\n\n     IN THE KITCHEN\n\n     Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...\n\n     Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...\n\n     Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins\n\n     to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...\n\n     Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...\n\n     Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...\n\n     Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen\n\n     sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.\n\n     Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the\n\n     counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...\n\n     Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...\n\n     Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,\n\n     tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...\n\n     Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...\n\n     Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets\n\n     him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles\n\n     airway with his forearm...\n\n     Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one\n\n     hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...\n\n     frantically feeling for anything he can use...\n\n     Welles' face is blood red...\n\n     Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...\n\n     Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!\n\n     Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching\n\n     around to the fork...\n\n     Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...\n\n     Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling\n\n     fingers.

He looks around the basement.\n\n     Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his\n\n     holster.  He stands looking at Machine.\n\n     Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling\n\n     mask, pulling it off.

The\n\n     ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.\n\n     Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with\n\n     tears.  He tries to fight it, but can't help himself.
