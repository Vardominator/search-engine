MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n\tThe roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins,\n\n\tsmoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by\n\n\twhat's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's\n\n\tcharred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,\n\n\tlistening to Leon.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEON\n\n\t\tSo, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine\n\n\t\tposition - that they were doin' each\n\n\t\tother but were so whacked out of their\n\n\t\theads they set the pipe on the mattress,\n\n\t\tlit it up, and they got fried.

With a pair of tweezers, Jordy\n\n\tpulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the\n\n\theads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth\n\n\tinside.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEON (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tWhat was that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tEvidence.

Don't wanna get\n\n\t\tyour pants wet.\n\n\tLeon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV\n\n\tset.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello\n\n\thacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the\n\n\tbodies and Korfin explains:\n\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\n\n\t\tThey have not soot in their mouths,\n\n\t\twhich means they weren't breathin'\n\n\t\tbefore the fire and that usually means\n\n\t\tthey were deceased - and this piece of\n\n\t\tcloth that my partner found means they\n\n\t\twere wrapped up in something, probably\n\n\t\tdoused with a flammable liquid and\n\n\t\tpositioned like this on the bed.

KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT\n\n\tAs the \"Top Story\" logo is splashed across the screen,\n\n\taccompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces\n\n\tAmerica's highest rated 'news magazine' show.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\n\n\t\tGood evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and\n\n\t\tthis is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you\n\n\t\tan exclusive interview with Stephen\n\n\t\tGeller - who horrified the nation two\n\n\t\tyears ago when he went berserk and\n\n\t\tmurdered three clerks in a Manhattan\n\n\t\tshoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's\n\n\t\tclaim, spoken softly and articulately,\n\n\t\tis that he is the victim.  According to\n\n\t\tMr. Geller, the events of that fateful\n\n\t\tday were not his fault but were the\n\n\t\tfault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to\n\n\t\tbelieve...watch.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (O.S.)\n\n\t\tLouder.\n\n\tVIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting\n\n\ton the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tLouder.\n\n\tOleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the\n\n\tvolume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being\n\n\tinterviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He's\n\n\tsitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint\n\n\tstained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the\n\n\tbackground.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird\n\n\tdysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the\n\n\tpaintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\n\n\t\tThis had nothing to do with shoes that\n\n\t\tdidn't fit or my relationship with my\n\n\t\tfather who, as you know, made a fortune\n\n\t\tselling penny loafers in the fifties. \n\n\t\tThese people died because of the\n\n\t\tcriminal actions of my doctor.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\n\n\t\tYour doctor?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\n\n\t\tYes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that\n\n\t\tI stay on my medication.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\n\n\t\t...so you feel absolutely no\n\n\t\tresponsibility for killing these people?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\n\n\t\tIt was my finger that pulled the\n\n\t\ttrigger, but I'm not morally\n\n\t\tresponsible.  My psychiatrist knew what\n\n\t\tI was capable of.  How could I know. \n\n\t\tI'm not a doctor.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\n\n\t\tYou seem very savvy for a man who's been\n\n\t\tfound mentally incompetent to stand\n\n\t\ttrial.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\n\n\t\tLook, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a\n\n\t\tyear away from getting my masters in\n\n\t\tArt, now I'll never graduate.  My life\n\n\t\thas been permanently disrupted.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\n\n\t\tPermanently disrupted?  Aren't you\n\n\t\tselling paintings now for quite a lot of\n\n\t\tmoney?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you\n\n\t\tcall it, jump started your career as an\n\n\t\tartist?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\n\n\t\tLook, I'm in here.  You call this a\n\n\t\tcareer move?\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\n\n\t\tAnd isn't there a movie in the works\n\n\t\tabout you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\n\n\t\tWe're in negotiations, that's correct.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERT HAWKINS\n\n\t\tBut doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent\n\n\t\tcriminals from profiting from their\n\n\t\tcrimes?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTEPHEN GELLER\n\n\t\tThat doesn't apply to me because I'm not\n\n\t\ta criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I\n\n\t\twasn't convicted.\n\n\tEmil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tI love America.  No one is responsible\n\n\t\tfor what they do.\n\n\tThere's a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over\n\n\tto it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.

Our POV backs into the bathroom,\n\n\tclosing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks\n\n\tdown at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife\n\n\tsticking out of Emil's BOOT.

Emil seems to have disappeared.\n\n\tLeon, gun raised, approaches the cafe.  As he rounds the\n\n\tcorner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face!  Leon\n\n\tcrashes into a table, dropping his gun.  Emil scoops up the\n\n\tgun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon.  BEATING the detective to a pulp. \n\n\tPeople are running from the scene.

It's an impossible\n\n\tshot, out of range.\n\n\tBut Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT.  Two\n\n\tblocks away, Emil topples.  Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,\n\n\tastonished he made the shot.  Emil scrambles to his feet. \n\n\tRuns.  Eddie holsters his weapon.

Looks at him.  Stands very close.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tI came here.  I had no money.  I knew no\n\n\t\tone.  I couldn't get a job because you\n\n\t\thave to have a green card to get work. \n\n\t\tThey approached me - I could've made a\n\n\t\tlot of money.  I considered it, but...\n\n\t\tit's not who I am.  They pay me below\n\n\t\tthe table at Ludwig's.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tSo you were never a prostitute?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tWhat are you asking me?\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tI'm just trying to find out who you are.\n\n\tShe looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he's\n\n\thinting.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tCan you let me go?\n\n\tShe leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to\n\n\tkiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning\n\n\tand backs up slightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tShowers are this way.\n\n\tDesperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even\n\n\tcloser.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tYou could shower with me.\n\n\tJordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks\n\n\taway.  Gestures towards the showers. \n\n\tDaphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the\n\n\tshowers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are\n\n\tlined with shower stalls.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tI'll uh, I'll get you a towel.\n\n\tHe leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the\n\n\twindow.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the\n\n\tstreet.\n\n\tJORDY\n\n\tgets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He\n\n\tchecks the number but decides not to return the call.  We\n\n\tfollow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he\n\n\tnotices the window.  It's open.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tShit!\n\n\tHe rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns -\n\n\tlooks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through\n\n\tthe curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over -\n\n\tquickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain\n\n\taside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding\n\n\therself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tAre you alright?\n\n\tJordy sits on the bench next to the shower.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tI'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tI know.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tYou don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was\n\n\t\tdesperate.  That's not me.  I shot a\n\n\t\tcop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to\n\n\t\tme when I got to prison?\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tThey're not gonna send you right back.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tI'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. \n\n\t\tActually I'm glad it's over.  All this\n\n\t\ttime.  Hiding.  Never being able to look\n\n\t\tanyone in the eyes. \n\n\t\tAlways afraid that someone would find\n\n\t\tout who I was.  Never trusting anyone...\n\n\tHe covers her with the towel, pulling her up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tYou can trust me.\n\n\tShe embraces him.  Trusting him.  He stands there for a\n\n\tmoment.  Then awkwardly holds her.  Comforting her.\n\n\t\tINT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n\tCLOSE UP\n\n\ton a steak.  Male hands cut a piece.

Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up\n\n\tas Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting\n\n\ttoward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the\n\n\twindow and one of the lampshades off the lamp.\n\n\tOleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn\n\n\ttoward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in\n\n\tthe stomach.\n\n\tEmil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S\n\n\tSTOMACH.\n\n\tEddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to\n\n\tthe chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got\n\n\tstabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be\n\n\tdying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain\n\n\tis terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a\n\n\tclose up.\n\n\tEmil looks at Eddie.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tDie.  Die.\n\n\tEmil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie\n\n\toff, suffocating him.\n\n\tBLACKNESS\n\n\tWe are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you\n\n\tfeel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally,\n\n\tin the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. \n\n\tWe slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a\n\n\ttiny pixel on a TV screen.\n\n\tWIDENING\n\n\tfurther out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.  It's\n\n\tan enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and\n\n\tdignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed\n\n\tover the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in\n\n\this NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg's reflection on the set with\n\n\tthe videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio\n\n\tfrom Eddie's funeral.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)\n\n\t\t..Detective Flemming was one of the most\n\n\t\tdecorated NYPD detectives in the history\n\n\t\tof New York.  He made several thousand\n\n\t\tarrests during his career, including the\n\n\t\tfamed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by\n\n\t\tthe community in which he served.  His\n\n\t\tpartner eulogized him...\n\n\tLeon is at the mic. \n\n\t\t\t\tLEON (ON T.V.)\n\n\t\t...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend\n\n\t\tand my partner...he taught me the\n\n\t\tmeaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man\n\n\t\tin every sense of the word.  I'll miss\n\n\t\thim...\n\n\t\t\t(choking on tears)\n\n\t\tSleep well, brother.\n\n\tLeon begins to sing \"Amazing Grace.\"  Oleg PANS from the TV\n\n\tand focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame -\n\n\tcarefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long\n\n\thypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is\n\n\tpulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. \n\n\tGingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again,\n\n\tthe plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a\n\n\ttable...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT\n\n\trevealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.\n\n\tINT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n\tIt's packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many\n\n\twho were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black\n\n\tribbon on their badges.  There's a quality of an Irish wake -\n\n\tboisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet\n\n\thas been laid out.\n\n\tHawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He\n\n\tgreets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tAwful...what an awful day.  He was New\n\n\t\tYork City.\n\n\tHawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It's\n\n\tTommy.  Hawkins nods to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tTOMMY\n\n\t\tI never got to tell him how much I\n\n\t\tadmired him.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tI know, son, I know.  We all loved him.\n\n\tHawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of\n\n\tthe bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves\n\n\tto her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at\n\n\thim.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. \n\n\tDefinitely drunk.  She's had many.  She turns to Hawkins.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tYou know...you know he was gonna propose\n\n\t\tto me.  The crime guys found a card he'd\n\n\t\twritten out to me.  And a ring\n\n\t\tbox...these fuckers that killed him -\n\n\t\thave my ring.  They have my diamond\n\n\t\tengagement ring...\n\n\tHawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tI know.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tWhat do you mean you know?  He told you\n\n\t\the was gonna propose to me?\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tWell, he...\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\t\t(overriding)\n\n\t\tI want to hear everything he said.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tI'm trying to tell you.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tAlright.  Go ahead.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tThat morning.  He was talking to me and\n\n\t\tLeon about marriage.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tOh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. \n\n\t\tHe started making overtures - talking\n\n\t\tabout little shoes next to his in his\n\n\t\tcloset but I got a call to anchor - and\n\n\t\tI walked out on him.  I walked out on\n\n\t\thim when he was trying to ask me to\n\n\t\tmarry him!!\n\n\tNicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tI'd never had a great relationship\n\n\t\tbefore.  I'd never made great choices\n\n\t\twith men.  And he wasn't easy to get to\n\n\t\tknow.  He was older, my parents told me\n\n\t\tI was nuts to get involved with him. \n\n\t\tBut he was so great to me.  Always\n\n\t\tencouraging, telling me I could do\n\n\t\tanything...\n\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\n\t\tHe was the one.  You know, I'd give up\n\n\t\teverything - everything - for just a\n\n\t\tlittle more time.  I would've spent\n\n\t\tfifteen minutes with him if that's all I\n\n\t\tknew I had.\n\n\tShe's lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him\n\n\toff - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A\n\n\twoman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAGGIE\n\n\t\tRobert...?\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tWhat are you doing here?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAGGIE\n\n\t\t\t(holding a cellular)\n\n\t\tYou've got a call.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tI can't talk to anybody right now, can't\n\n\t\tyou see I'm busy!  I can't talk\n\n\t\tbusiness.  Hang up.  Have a drink.\n\n\t\t\t(to Paulie)\n\n\t\tGet her a whiskey.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAGGIE\n\n\t\tTrust me, you'll want to take this call.\n\n\tRobert steps off the stool.  Takes the phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tHello?  Who is this?\n\n\t\t\t(listens)\n\n\t\tHow do I know this is you?\n\n\tHawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder. \n\n\tBacks away from the bar.  Now out of hearing distance, he\n\n\tlooks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tWhere?\n\n\tWe INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie\n\n\ttheater.  Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws\n\n\tglances into the theater.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tCome to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the\n\n\t\tPolice.  Come alone or you'll be in my\n\n\t\tnext film.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\t\t(low)\n\n\t\tLook asshole.  I've been threatened by\n\n\t\tbetter than you.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tNo.  I'm the best that's ever threatened\n\n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tI'll meet you on one condition - I get\n\n\t\texclusivity and you surrender to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tWe'll talk about that.  Four o'clock\n\n\t\tgives you time to go to bank.  Three\n\n\t\thundred thousand dollars.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tWhat?  It doesn't work that way.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\t\t(incensed)\n\n\t\tIf you don't want my film - I'll call\n\n\t\tanother show.  And they will show it.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tWait a minute.  Wait a minute.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tCome alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk\n\n\t\tabout surrendering.\n\n\tCLICK.  The line goes dead.  Hawkins disconnects.  Hands the\n\n\tphone back to Maggie.  She's looking at him.  Excited. \n\n\tHawkins looks at Nicolette.  His mind whirls.\n\n\tINT. FIRE STATION 91 - KITCHEN - DAY\n\n\tDaphne and Korfin are sitting at a table.  Korfin's arm is in\n\n\ta sling, his side bandaged.  Duffy and Jordy enter in their\n\n\tdress uniforms.  Korfin walks over to them.\n\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\n\n\t\tHow was it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\t\t(numb)\n\n\t\tNot good.\n\n\tJordy's quiet.  Dazed.  Nobody can believe Eddie's gone.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUFFY\n\n\t\t\t(nods to Daphne)\n\n\t\tDid the D.A. videotape her deposition?\n\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\n\n\t\tYeah.

You got\n\n\t\tthat?\n\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\n\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\tJordy looks at her.  Duffy sees them hold each other's look.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tChief - mind if I take her?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUFFY\n\n\t\tOkay.  But not water sports.\n\n\tDuffy walks out.  Jordy leads Daphne out of the station. \n\n\tKorfin follows.  A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello\n\n\twho points as Jordy walks by.  The man chases after Jordy.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\n\t\tExcuse me - Jordan Warsaw?\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\n\t\t\t(shoving papers in Jordy's\n\n\t\t\t hand)\n\n\t\tConsider yourself served.\n\n\tJordy opens the papers.  Korfin puts Daphne in the car. \n\n\tWalks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tKORFIN\n\n\t\tZwangendaba??? Is suing you, the\n\n\t\tdepartment and the city of New York for\n\n\t\t10 million?  Who is Zwangendaba?\n\n\tJordy remembers...and gets more depressed.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tThe mugger.\n\n\t\tEXT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n\tIt's an old brownstone - in poor condition.  Jordy pulls up. \n\n\tOpens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering\n\n\ther to the door.  He is edgy.  Jumpy.  Looking around.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tAre you alright?\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tI still can't believe Eddie's gone.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tI'm sorry.\n\n\tHe looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the\n\n\tfront door opens.  A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.  Jordy pulls\n\n\tDaphne out of the way.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\t\t(in Czech to the man)\n\n\t\tHello.  How are you?\n\n\tINT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tJordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.  A bouquet of\n\n\tflowers are outside Daphne's apartment.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tWhat's this?\n\n\tShe takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.  Daphne\n\n\treads: \"Good luck with all your troubles.  I'm here if you\n\n\tneed me...Ludwig.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tIs he your boyfriend?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tLudwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tIf I was your boyfriend, I might be.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tIf you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest\n\n\t\tyou find another girlfriend that isn't\n\n\t\tgoing to jail ten-thousand miles away.\n\n\tThey're staring in each other's eyes.  The sexual tension\n\n\tstrong.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tA good Immigration lawyer could stall\n\n\t\tthe process.  Eddie recommended one.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tNo matter what happens...I'm glad I met\n\n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tI'm glad I met you.\n\n\tThey hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss. \n\n\tUrgently.  Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. \n\n\tThey part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the\n\n\thall.  Jordy clears his throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tLet's get your stuff.\n\n\tHe opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to\n\n\ther.  Gestures that it's okay to enter.\n\n\tINT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tIt's very small.  Almost no furniture.  The bare minimum. \n\n\tThe apartment is a hole.  She looks at Jordy.  Both thinking\n\n\tthe same thought.  Another kiss. \n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tYou better get packed.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tRight.\n\n\tShe holds his look.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tDo you have coffee?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tIn the kitchen.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tI'll make some for us.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tI'll get my clothes.\n\n\tShe heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He\n\n\tflips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES -\n\n\tSETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO\n\n\tTHE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tJordy!!!\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tNo!  Get back!  GET BACK!!!\n\n\tJordy's more surprised than shaken.  It's a fire - he knows\n\n\tthe drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices\n\n\ta FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it\n\n\tat the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne\n\n\tSCREAMS!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tThat's not mine!\n\n\tWHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames\n\n\tleap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher\n\n\tbecause it's filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy\n\n\tCAN'T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and\n\n\tJORDY'S HAND.\n\n\tHe flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. \n\n\tCloses the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it\n\n\tunder the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He\n\n\thurries into the living room.  Knowing it's moments before\n\n\tthe extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. \n\n\tHits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a\n\n\tchair through the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tDon't!  It'll suck the flames toward us!\n\n\tToo late.  She SMASHES the window.  There's an EXPLOSION in\n\n\tthe kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along\n\n\tthe ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone:\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tThis is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075,\n\n\t\tmake it quick, we're trapped!  8th\n\n\t\tAvenue and 44th Street.\n\n\tHe pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.  It's locked.  Jordy\n\n\tkicks it open.  Grabs the comforter off the bed.  Shoves that\n\n\tunder the door jam.  He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. \n\n\tShuts the door.  Runs his severely burned hand under the cold\n\n\twater.  Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. \n\n\tShe notices someone has nailed the window shut.  And on top\n\n\tof one nail...is Eddie's gold shield.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tOh my G-d!  Oh my G-d!\n\n\tJordy turns - sees Eddie's shield.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tThey were here!\n\n\tThis freaks her out.  They were in her home.  She starts to\n\n\tpanic.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tCalm down.  Get a hold of yourself!  Get\n\n\t\tdown!\n\n\tHe pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub.  In it is a CAN OF\n\n\tGASOLINE.  A virtual bomb.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tOh Jesus!\n\n\tDaphne reaches for the can of gasoline.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tWhat are you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE\n\n\t\tPouring it out!\n\n\tShe grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain.  The\n\n\tFIRE is raging outside the bathroom.  The bathroom door is\n\n\tbeginning to smoke and burn.  They are trapped.\n\n\tJordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the\n\n\twall to the ceiling.  He throws his feet against the wall for\n\n\tleverage.  Pulls with all his might to break it loose.  It's\n\n\tcreaking - but he's having a hard time with it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAPHNE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tOh shit!\n\n\tJordy looks over.  The gasoline she's pouring out - is not\n\n\tgoing down the drain.  It's stopped up.  As soon as the fire\n\n\tgets in the bathroom, everything will explode!\n\n\tJordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. \n\n\tDaphne comes over - helps him.  Both of them trying to break\n\n\tit off.  Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. \n\n\tSOAKING THE WALLS.  They point the pipe toward the door,\n\n\tsoaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. \n\n\tTrying to stop the fire from coming in.  He and Daphne are\n\n\tdrenched.  And trapped.\n\n\tJordy grabs a broken piece of pipe.  Starts SMASHING the wall\n\n\tbehind them.  The wall to the adjacent apartment.\n\n\tVIDEO POV\n\n\tJordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire. \n\n\tCAMERA WHIP PANS down the street as FIRE ENGINES arrive.\n\n\tOLEG\n\n\tis VIDEOTAPING them from the opposite rooftop.

Welcome to \"Top Story\". \n\n\t\tTonight, I present to you material of a\n\n\t\tgraphic and violent nature never before\n\n\t\tseen on television.  And I do so with a\n\n\t\theavy heart.  You will be first-hand\n\n\t\twitness to the slaying of celebrated New\n\n\t\tYork City Homicide Detective, Eddie\n\n\t\tFlemming.  It would be only normal to\n\n\t\task, why?  Why are we showing something\n\n\t\tso journalist, I must show it.  A\n\n\t\tdemocracy survives through the freedom\n\n\t\tof its media, and if we cannot see what\n\n\t\tis happening then we don't deserve our\n\n\t\tdemocracy, or our freedom.  Eddie\n\n\t\tFlemming was my friend.  I cried when I\n\n\t\twatched this footage and vowed to fight\n\n\t\tthis violence with every molecule of my\n\n\t\tbeing from this day onward.  Hopefully,\n\n\t\tthis will have a similar effect on you. \n\n\t\tOne final word, this material is\n\n\t\tabsolutely not appropriate for children.\n\n\tThe restaurant BUZZES.

Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. \n\n\tLeaves him in a ball on the floor.  Oleg comes at Eddie and\n\n\the knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  The\n\n\tblinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more\n\n\tlight.  Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.  Oleg kneels down\n\n\tfor a CLOSE-UP.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tDie.  Die.\n\n\tEXT.

Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside,\n\n\tfreaking.  He's lost the most important thing in his life.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tOh no!  No!

Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster\n\n\tand sticks it in his pocket.\n\n\tCLOSE ON METER\n\n\tto $42.00.

The anger rising inside his body is\n\n\tcoming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is\n\n\tsitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with\n\n\trage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up\n\n\tand walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand\n\n\tgrips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.\n\n\tHIGH WIDE SHOT\n\n\tMany policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. \n\n\tAll are waiting for Emil.

The swarm follows - firing questions at\n\n\tCutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with:\n\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER\n\n\t\t...my client was suffering from a major\n\n\t\tillness of schizophrenic nature wherein\n\n\t\tduring times of intense stress, as a\n\n\t\tresult of paranoid and psychotic\n\n\t\tdelusions - there was impairment of his\n\n\t\tability to appreciate wrongfullness...\n\n\t\tThis is a victory for the mentally ill!\n\n\tJordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on\n\n\tEmil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max,\n\n\tthe celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? \n\n\tMax's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam\n\n\tin his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other\n\n\tcops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their\n\n\tplace in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.

Jordy grips the gun inside the\n\n\tjacket.\n\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER\n\n\t\t\t(to a nearby escort)\n\n\t\tOfficer, keep this man back, he's\n\n\t\tassaulted my client on previous\n\n\t\toccasions.\n\n\tA PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tThis is it?  This bastard kills the best\n\n\t\tcop this city ever had and we do\n\n\t\tnothing?\n\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER\n\n\t\tYou may not like it marshal, but that's\n\n\t\tthe law.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tAnd what about the other victims??  What\n\n\t\tabout their families?  He'll end up in\n\n\t\tsome country club nuthouse while his\n\n\t\tlawyer sells his rights to the movies\n\n\t\tand we just stand here and do nothing? \n\n\t\tWe let this scumbag walk?\n\n\tJordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. \n\n\tGets in Jordy's face.  Laughs quietly.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tBe careful.  I can kill you.  I'm\n\n\t\tinsane.\n\n\tJordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the\n\n\tcops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:\n\n\tA VIDEO POV\n\n\tas it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame\n\n\ttapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who\n\n\the's been waiting for.  His face lights up.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tI thought you wouldn't show up.  Where\n\n\t\tis it?  Where is the tape?\n\n\tIT'S OLEG\n\n\tIn disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera.\n\n\t\t\t\tOLEG\n\n\t\tIt's all in here.  All in here.\n\n\tMEANWHILE JORDY\n\n\thas been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice\n\n\tcuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tWait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some\n\n\t\tinteresting evidence, something you\n\n\t\tshould look at!\n\n\tReporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he\n\n\tcontinues introducing his broadcast:\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tI have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL\n\n\t\tUNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,\n\n\t\tproving Emil Slovak was not insane! \n\n\t\tHard to believe...watch!\n\n\tReporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his\n\n\tvideocamera up in the air.\n\n\t\t\t\tOLEG (ON VIDEO)\n\n\t\tHe knew exactly what he was doing - all\n\n\t\tof this was planned!  It's all here in\n\n\t\tmy movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. \n\n\t\tLook!\n\n\tOleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts\n\n\tof the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (ON VIDEO)\n\n\t\t...so we kill someone famous and if we\n\n\t\tare caught, we are sent to mental\n\n\t\thospital...\n\n\t\t\t\tCUTLER\n\n\t\t\t(points to Oleg)\n\n\t\tOfficers, there's your killer, do your\n\n\t\tduty, arrest him!\n\n\tThe police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of\n\n\treporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the\n\n\tpress corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy\n\n\tnotices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE\n\n\tCAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which\n\n\tkilled Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He\n\n\tyells at Oleg!\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tTraitor!!\n\n\t\t\t\tOLEG\n\n\t\tNo.  You are the traitor.  You are\n\n\t\tmurderer.  I am director.  Action!\n\n\tOleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:\n\n\tBANG!\n\n\tOleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings\n\n\this camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. \n\n\tOleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER\n\n\tescorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer's gun.  He\n\n\tswivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are\n\n\tscreaming.  It's CHAOS.\n\n\tEmil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. \n\n\tHe puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at\n\n\ther head.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\n\t\tDrop the gun!  DON'T SHOOT!\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tI'll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back\n\n\t\taway from me!\n\n\tWe hear Jordy's voice above Emil.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tLet her go.  Let her fucking go!!\n\n\tThe captain is screaming at all his men.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\n\t\tNo one shoot!  Lower your weapons!  Do\n\n\t\tnot fire!  No officer will fire his\n\n\t\tweapon unless I say so!\n\n\t\t\t(to Emil)\n\n\t\tLet the woman go!\n\n\tCops reluctantly lower their weapons.  But Jordy is still\n\n\taiming his gun at Emil.  He is the only one who hasn't\n\n\tlowered his gun.  The captain is yelling at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tHolster your weapons!  Back away.  That\n\n\t\tis an order!  No officers will fire!\n\n\tEmil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at\n\n\tEmil.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tTell him to put his gun down!\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tLet her go!  Let her go!!\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tIf he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking\n\n\t\tkill her.\n\n\tJordy doesn't lower his gun.  Emil tries to back away.  The\n\n\treporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping\n\n\ttheir lenses pointed at the scene.  This is great film! \n\n\tJordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tLet her go.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tShoot!  Shoot him!!\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tShut up!\n\n\tMeanwhile, the captain is still yelling:\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\n\t\tNo on shoot!  No one shoot!!  No officer\n\n\t\twill follow.  No officer will shoot!\n\n\tNicolette is still encouraging Jordy.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tShoot!  Shoot!  Shoot him!!\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL\n\n\t\tShut up!\n\n\tEveryone is screaming at once.  It's mass chaos.  The captain\n\n\tis trying to keep everyone calm.  Cops following along with\n\n\ttheir weapons lowered.  All except Jordy - his gun still\n\n\tpointed at Emil. \n\n\tHawkins can't believe what footage he's getting.  He's\n\n\tpushing his cameraman to the front of the pack.  Trying to\n\n\tget the best coverage.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMIL (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tI'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he\n\n\t\tlowers his gun.\n\n\tHe's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away\n\n\ttowards the police boat.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tDon't.  Don't let him surrender.  Shoot\n\n\t\thim!\n\n\tJordy won't take his gun off him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tLet her go.  Let her go.\n\n\tThe captain is yelling at Jordy.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\n\t\tLower your weapon.  I told you - lower\n\n\t\tyour weapon!\n\n\tJordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil.  He can't.  His\n\n\theart pounding.  Adrenaline pumping.  He suddenly lowers his\n\n\tweapon.  Turns away.  The captain visibly relaxes.  Emil\n\n\tlaughs.  Jordy suddenly turns back.  Quickly raises his\n\n\tweapon.\n\n\tJORDY SHOOTS\n\n\tEmil takes a shot in the leg.  Nicolette ducks under the\n\n\thandcuffs and scurries away.  Emil looks at Jordy - surprised\n\n\the shot him.  Jordy FIRES AGAIN.  Emil is hit in the\n\n\tshoulder.  Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's\n\n\tchest.  Abdomen.  Head.  Gun fire echoes in the humid air as\n\n\tEmil stumbles back.  Does a funny dance and drops to the\n\n\tground.  Dead.  The captain yells.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tI told you not to shoot!  No officers\n\n\t\tshould shoot.\n\n\tJordy quietly answers:\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tI'm not a cop.  I'm a fire marshal.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n\n\t\tHe's still alive.\n\n\tHawkins looks down at Oleg.  He is sprawled on the ground. \n\n\tHis videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.\n\n\tOLEG'S VIDEO POV\n\n\tas it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.  He\n\n\tlooks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:\n\n\t\t\t\tOLEG\n\n\t\tA film...by Oleg Razgul.\n\n\tAnd Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.  Hawkins\n\n\tjumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.\n\n\t\t\t\tOLEG (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tHow was that?\n\n\tOleg's head rolls to one side.  Now dead.  Nicolette runs\n\n\tover to Jordy.  Composing herself.  Coming together.  Glad\n\n\tEmil is dead.  Jordy starts to walk away.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tWait a minute.  Where are you going? \n\n\t\tLearn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of\n\n\t\tpublic opinion.  Take the credit, you\n\n\t\tneed it.\n\n\tShe turns him around.  Straightens his tie.  Starts to push\n\n\tthe hair out of his face but he stops her hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJORDY\n\n\t\tNo thanks.\n\n\tJordy puts something in her hand.  She looks down.  It's\n\n\tEDDIE'S BADGE.  The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom. \n\n\tShe looks up at him.  Her cameraman rolling.  The lens\n\n\tpointed at Jordy.  Jordy looks at Nicolette.  Meets her eyes. \n\n\tHe doesn't want to make a statement.  He still doesn't want\n\n\tthe fame.  He did learn from Eddie.  Eddie was killed because\n\n\the was a celebrity.  Jordy wants no part of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n\n\t\tCut.\n\n\tHer cameraman lowers his leans.  Jordy smiles.  She nods. \n\n\tJordy turns and walks away.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tGet a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to\n\n\t\tme.\n\n\tJordy disappears into the sea of people.  The camera PANS\n\n\tback to Nicolette.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tWell, he wouldn't talk to us, but you\n\n\t\tsaw it.\n\n\tThe CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette's face and the video is\n\n\tnow on:\n\n\tTHE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE\n\n\tWe PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER.  Nicolette finishing her\n\n\tstand up:\n\n\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\n\n\t\tNew York City has a new hero, Fire\n\n\t\tMarshal Jordan Warsaw.  I hope that Fire\n\n\t\tMarshal Warsaw's heroic actions this\n\n\t\tafternoon will help with his other legal\n\n\t\tproblems.  WB11 has also learned that\n\n\t\tthe fire Marshal has retained an\n\n\t\timmigration lawyer to help Daphne\n\n\t\tHandlova with her case.  We wish her\n\n\t\twell.  This is Nicolette Karas, live at\n\n\t\tBattery Park, WB11 New York.  Good\n\n\t\tnight.\n\n\tTHE SCREEN\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t FADES TO BLACK."}
